## ðŸ§© Mutating Objects

### Concatenation: Does Not Mutate Objects
- **Example:**
  ```python
  names = ['Eric', 'John']
  names = names + ['Michael']
  ```
- ðŸŸ¢ **What Happens?** 
  - Python creates a **new object** with a different memory address containing `['Eric', 'John', 'Michael']`.
  - The original list is **NOT** mutated. We are simply reassigning `names` to the new list.
- **Key Point:** Concatenation creates **new objects**, it does **not mutate** the original list.

### Appending: Mutating an Object
- **Example:**
  ```python
  names.append('Michael')
  ```
- ðŸŸ¢ **What Happens?**
  - The list's state is **mutated** to include `'Michael'`.
  - **Memory address stays the same**! The object is mutated **in-place**.
- **Key Point:** `append()` mutates the list **without changing** the memory address.

## ðŸ”§ Mutating Using Square Brackets & Slicing
- You can mutate sequences using **square bracket notation**:
  ```python
  s[i] = new_element
  ```
- You can also mutate via **slicing**:
  ```python
  s[i:j] = new_iterable
  ```
  This will replace the slice `s[i:j]` with the elements of `new_iterable`.
  
### Deleting Elements
- **Delete a single element:**
  ```python
  del s[i]
  ```
- **Delete a slice:**
  ```python
  del s[i:j]
  ```

### Mutating Extended Slices
- Extended slices allow mutation with a **step**:
  ```python
  s[i:j:k] = new_iterable
  ```
  There are **limitations** here that we'll explore later.

## ðŸ“š More Methods for Mutable Sequence Types (e.g., Lists)

Here are some other useful methods available for lists:

### `clear()`
- **What it does:** Removes **all elements** from the sequence.
- **Key Point:** Mutates the object, but **does not** create a new one.

### `append()`
- **What it does:** Adds a single element to the **end** of the sequence.
  
### `insert(i, x)`
- **What it does:** Inserts element `x` at index `i`. Elements to the right will **shift**.

### `extend(iterable)`
- **What it does:** Appends all elements from an **iterable** to the sequence.

### `pop(i)`
- **What it does:** Removes and **returns** the element at index `i`.
- **Use case:** Itâ€™s a combination of **read** and **remove**.

### `remove(x)`
- **What it does:** Removes the **first occurrence** of `x` in the sequence.
- **Note:** Raises an exception if `x` is not found.

### `reverse()`
- **What it does:** Reverses the sequence **in-place**.

## ðŸ§  Copying

### `copy()`
- **What it does:** Creates a **new** sequence that is a **shallow copy** of the original.
- **Key Point:** Be cautious of shallow copies; we'll explore this more when we discuss **deep copies** in upcoming lectures.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- **Concatenation:** Creates new objects, doesnâ€™t mutate.
- **Append/Insert/Extend:** Mutates the original list **in-place**.
- **Pop/Remove:** Removes elements either by **index** (`pop`) or **value** (`remove`).
- **Clear/Reverse:** Mutates the list **in-place** without creating new objects.
- **Copy:** Creates a shallow copy (watch out for deeper issues!).
