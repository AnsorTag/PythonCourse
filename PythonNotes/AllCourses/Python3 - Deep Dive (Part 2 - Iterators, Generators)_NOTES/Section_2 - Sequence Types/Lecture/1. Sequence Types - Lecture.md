coding lesson notes: [[1. Sequence Types - Code]]

---
## What is a Sequence?

- A **sequence** is a collection of elements where **position matters**. For example, a sequence `S` could have elements `x1, x2, x3, x4` that we can reference by their **index**.  
  - 🔢 Python starts index numbers at **0**. So, in the sequence `S = [x0, x1, x2, x3]`, `x2` refers to the **third element**.

## Sequence vs Other Containers

- Sequences have **positional ordering** 📍 (e.g., lists), but not all containers do.  
  - Lists ✅ are sequences, but sets ❌ are **not**.

## 🔄 Mutable & Immutable Sequence Types

- **Mutable Sequences** (can be changed):
  - `list`
  - `bytearray`

- **Immutable Sequences** (cannot be changed):
  - `string` 🧵
  - `tuple` 📦
  - `range` 🔢
  - `bytes`

- Note: A **tuple** is more than just a sequence; it's also a **data structure**.

## Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Sequences

- **Homogeneous sequences** have elements of the **same type** 🧩:
  - e.g., Strings (`"Python"`)
  
- **Heterogeneous sequences** can contain elements of **different types** 🧷:
  - e.g., Lists `[int, float, string]`

- Homogeneous sequences are often more **efficient**.

## 🔁 Iterable vs Sequence

- **Iterable**: Any object we can **loop over** (e.g., lists, sets) 🌀
- **Sequence**: Iterable with **positional access**. Not all iterables are sequences (e.g., sets are iterable but not sequences).

## 🛠️ Standard Sequence Methods

1. `x in s` → Check if `x` is in the sequence.
2. `s + s` → **Concatenation** (joins two sequences).
3. `s * n` → **Repetition** (repeats the sequence `n` times).
4. `len(s)` → Get the **length** of the sequence.
5. `min(s)`, `max(s)` → Get the **min/max** values (if elements are comparable).
6. `s.index(x)` → Find the **first occurrence** of `x`.
7. **Slicing**: `s[i:j]` → Get elements from index `i` to `j-1`.
   - 🚨 Upper bound `j` is **excluded**.
8. **Extended slicing**: `s[i:j:k]` → Get elements with a **step** size of `k`.

## 🧮 Range Objects (Sequence Type)

- `range` objects are sequences but **more limited**:
  - No concatenation/repetition ❌
  - Supports `min`, `max`, `len`, but less efficient.
  - Supports **slicing** (returns a new range object).

## ⚠️ Hashing & Mutable Types

- **Immutable sequences** (e.g., tuples) may support **hashing**.
  - **Mutable types** ❌ cannot be hashed.
  - We’ll explore this more in **dictionaries** and **sets**.

## 🔗 Concatenation & Repetition Caveats

- **Concatenation** of sequences creates a **new object**.
  - **Watch out for mutable objects!** If a sequence contains mutable elements (e.g., lists), the same object can appear multiple times, causing unexpected mutations 🔄.
  - Example:
    ```python
    x = [[0, 0]]
    a = x + x  # [[0, 0], [0, 0]] (same object twice)
    a[0][0] = 100  # Mutates both! [[100, 0], [100, 0]]
    ```

- **Repetition** has the same issue:
  - For immutable types (e.g., strings, ints), it's **safe**:
    ```python
    a = [1, 2] * 2  # [1, 2, 1, 2]
    ```
  - For mutable types, the repeated items are **the same object**:
    ```python
    x = [[0, 0]]
    a = x * 2  # [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
    a[0][0] = 100  # Mutates both! [[100, 0], [100, 0]]
    ```
