coding lesson notes: [[5. Copying Sequences - Code]]

# PART 1
## Why Copy Sequences/Objects? 🤔

- **Mutability**: Mutable objects can be changed unintentionally. 
  - When working with third-party libraries or functions, they might **mutate** your data without you knowing.
  - Example: Concatenation and repetition of objects can lead to unintended modifications.
- You may want to **guard** against these changes by copying objects before passing them to functions.

---

## Example: Bad Practice ❌

```python
def reverse(s):
    s.reverse()  # Mutates the sequence
    return s     # Returns the same mutated sequence
```

- The function above **mutates** the sequence and returns it.
- If we pass a list `s`, reverse it, and assign it to a new list `t`, both `t` and `s` are reversed! 😱
  - **Better practice**: Mutate inside the function but **don't return** the sequence.
  
**Improved Code Example**:

```python
def reverse_in_place(s):
    s.reverse()  # Mutates but doesn't return anything
```

- 🔧 **Even better**: Copy the sequence, then reverse it.

```python
def reverse_copy(s):
    copy = s.copy()  # Create a copy first
    copy.reverse()   # Reverse the copy
    return copy      # Return the reversed copy
```

## Methods for Copying Sequences 📋

1. **Using a Loop** 🌀
   ```python
   copy = []
   for item in s:
       copy.append(item)
   ```
   - **Non-Pythonic** 😕, but it works.

2. **List Comprehension** 🔄
   ```python
   copy = [item for item in s]
   ```
   - A **Pythonic** way to create a new list from an existing one.
   
3. **Using `copy()` method** 📜
   ```python
   copy = s.copy()
   ```
   - Works for lists but **not** for immutable types like **tuples** and **strings**.
   
4. **Slicing** ✂️
   ```python
   copy = s[:]
   ```
   - Slicing always returns a **new object** but **shares** the memory of elements.

5. **`list()` or `tuple()` function** 🛠️
   ```python
   copy = list(s)
   ```
   - Converts any iterable to a list (or tuple).

---

## Immutable Types 🛑

- **Tuples** and **strings** are immutable.
  - If you try to copy a tuple using `tuple()`, it returns the **same tuple**:
    ```python
    t = (1, 2, 3)
    copy = tuple(t)  # Same tuple, no new object created
    ```
  - **Why?** Tuples can't be changed, so copying them is unnecessary.

---

## Shallow Copies 🌊

- **Shallow Copy**: Creates a **new container** (list/sequence), but the **elements inside** still point to the same memory addresses.
  - Example:
    ```python
    s = [10, 20, 30]
    copy = s.copy()  # Shallow copy
    copy[0] = 100    # Modifies the copy, not the original
    ```
  - **Key**: It copies the sequence but **not the elements**.

### Mutable Elements 🔄

- What happens if the elements inside the list are **mutable**? 
  - Example:
    ```python
    s = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]  # Nested lists
    copy = s.copy()
    copy[0][0] = 100
    ```
  - Both `s` and `copy` will have their first element changed to `100` because they still **share the same object in memory**.

---

## Summary 📝

- **Copying sequences** helps protect your original data from unintended mutations.
- **Shallow copies** duplicate the outer container but the inner elements still refer to the same memory.
- Use **copying methods** like `copy()`, **slicing**, and **list comprehensions** carefully, especially with **mutable** objects inside your sequences.

### 🧠 **Deep Copies** 🧠
When shallow copies aren't enough, we use **deep copies** to ensure changes made to the copy don't affect the original object.

- 🔄 Applies to all **mutable** objects, not just sequences.
- ✅ Deep copy: Copies not only the sequence but also each element inside, preventing shared references to mutable elements.

### 💡 **How It Works** 💡
1. We start with a sequence `S` that contains two mutable objects.
2. A deep copy creates **copies of every element** in `S`, not just the sequence itself:
   - **List comprehension** creates new copies of the elements inside `S`.
   - **Deep copy** ensures that each mutable element is cloned, avoiding shared references.
   
> **Note:** If an element in `S` contains further mutable objects, deep copies need to be applied recursively.

### 🚨 **Deep Copies & Recursion** 🚨
Deep copies often require recursion to ensure that all levels of nested objects are copied. 
For example:
- Outer sequence `S` contains two lists (mutable objects).
- A deep copy would recursively copy the lists, ensuring no shared references.
- Deep copying stops once it encounters **immutable elements** (e.g., integers, strings).

#### 🔁 **Circular References** 🔁
When making deep copies, be mindful of **circular references**:
- Example: List `B` contains list `A` and then appends itself back to `A`, creating a loop.
- Circular references can lead to **infinite recursion** if not handled properly!

### 📂 **Built-In Copying Methods** 📂

1. **Shallow Copies**:
   - Built-in objects like **lists, sets, and dictionaries** have a `copy()` method for shallow copies.
   - Shallow copies only duplicate the outer object, leaving references to the inner mutable elements intact.

2. **Deep Copies**:
   - The **`copy` module** provides:
     - `copy()` – for shallow copies.
     - `deepcopy()` – for true deep copies.
   - Use `deepcopy()` when you need a full copy, including nested mutable elements.

### 🛠 **Custom Classes & Copying** 🛠
Custom classes can implement `__copy__()` and `__deepcopy__()` to control how copies are made:
- **Shallow Copy** – duplicates the outer object without copying nested objects.
- **Deep Copy** – recursively duplicates all objects.

---

### 🔍 **Example** 🔍

```python
from copy import deepcopy

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a

# Creating an instance
x = [10, 20]  # mutable object
obj = MyClass(x)  # 'a' points to 'x'

# Shallow copy
shallow = copy(obj)  # shallow.a still points to 'x'

# Deep copy
deep_copy = deepcopy(obj)  # deep_copy.a points to a new copy of 'x'
```

- **Shallow Copy:** Both `shallow.a` and `obj.a` point to the same `x`. 
- **Deep Copy:** `deep_copy.a` now points to a **new copy** of `x`.

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Deep Copies in Action** 🧑‍💻
- Let's say we have a class instance with a mutable object.
- When using **`deepcopy()`**, Python ensures that all mutable objects are duplicated.
- Even if there are nested mutable objects, Python intelligently ensures all levels are copied without redundancy.

> 🧠 Python keeps track of what has already been copied to **avoid redundant copies** and circular references.

---

### 🔗 **Maintaining Relationships** 🔗
In deep copies, relationships between objects are maintained by re-using references when necessary:
- If an object points to another mutable object that’s already been copied, Python will reuse that reference in the deep copy.
- This ensures the **correct relationship** between copies is preserved.
