## 🔍 Why Start at Zero for Indexing?

- **Question:** Why does sequence indexing start at 0, not 1? 🤔
  - It's not just Python! Other languages also start at 0.
  - What about slicing bounds? 🤷‍♂️
    - Slicing includes `i` but **excludes** `j`.

- **Key Point:** This choice isn’t random. There are practical reasons behind it. Let’s explore! 🎯

## 🔢 Handling Consecutive Integers

- When talking about sequence **indices**, we’re really discussing **consecutive integers**.
  - Example sequence: `[A, B, C, D]` 👉 Indexing: `0, 1, 2, 3`
  - **Why start at 0 instead of 1?** Let’s break it down using slices. 🍕

### Example: Slice Bounds

Consider the sequence:  
`1, 2, 3, ..., 15`

### 📏 Ways to describe this sequence:
1. `n ≥ 1` and `n ≤ 15`
2. `n > 0` (which implies `n = 1`)
3. `n ≥ 1` and `n < 16`
4. `n > 0` and `n < 16`

> 😅 **Issue:** Options 2 and 4 become awkward when handling **unsigned integers** like `0, 1, 2...`.  
> **Solution:** Stick with options 1 and 3 (simpler!).

## 🔢 Counting Elements in a Sequence

Sequence: **2 to 16**  
How many elements? **15**

### 🧮 Formulas to get the number of elements:
- **A:** `16 - 2 + 1 = 15` (Need to add 1)
- **C:** `17 - 2 = 15` (No need to add 1!)

**Conclusion:** Method C is simpler!

### ✍️ Standard Convention:
- **Lower Bound:** Inclusive (≤)
- **Upper Bound:** Exclusive (<)

## 🧠 Why Zero-Based Indexing? 

- **Example Sequence:** 2, 3, 4... up to 16 (length = 15).
- **Indexing at 1:**  
  - 1-based indices: `1, 2, 3, ..., 15`
  - Formula: `1 ≤ n < 16`
  - Upper bound = length + 1
- **Switching to 0-based indexing:**  
  - 0-based indices: `0, 1, 2, ..., 14`
  - Formula: `0 ≤ n < 15`
  - Upper bound = length ✅

> **Result:** Zero-based indexing simplifies the upper bound! 🎉  
> The upper bound is now the length of the sequence, without needing to add 1. 💡

## 🧩 Simplicity of Zero-Based Indexing

- **Example:** Sequence `A, B, C, D` (indices: `0, 1, 2, 3`)
  - **How many elements come before 'D'?**
    - **1-based index (D = 4):** `4 - 1 = 3`
    - **0-based index (D = 3):** `3 = 3` ✨ **Simpler!**

## ✂️ Slicing in Python

- **Slice Notation:** `[l:u]` (from index `l` to `u`, not including `u`)
  - This slicing **includes** the lower bound and **excludes** the upper bound.

### 📝 Example: Slicing Sequence `[A, B, C, D, E, F]`
  - `s[2:4]` 👉 gives `[C, D]` (Excludes 'E')
  - **Visual Tip:** Think of indices as being **between** the elements.
  
  ```text
  Indices:  0   1   2   3   4   5  
           [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F]
  ```

## 🚀 Why Python's Slicing is Handy

1. **Get the first two elements:**
   - `s[0:2]` = `['A', 'B']` 
   - Shortcut: `s[:2]` (Python automatically fills in `0`)

2. **Grab remaining elements:**  
   - `s[2:]` = `['C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`

---

## 🎯 Splitting Sequences

To split a sequence into two:
- First `k` elements: `s[:k]`
- Remaining elements: `s[k:]`

Example:
- `k = 3`  
  - First 3 elements: `s[:3]`  
  - Remaining elements: `s[3:]`

---

## 🔑 Summary

- We use **zero-based indexing** because it simplifies calculations.
  - Index range: `0 ≤ n < len(s)`  
  - Slicing is **inclusive** of the lower bound and **exclusive** of the upper bound.
- The **last index** of a sequence is `len(s) - 1`.
- Slicing is your friend when it comes to splitting sequences and grabbing elements! 🍰
