# PART 1

## 🎯 Overview
In this video, we're going to dive deeper into **slicing**. We've used slicing before, but now it's time to explore what it really is! 🧐

## 🧩 Understanding Slicing
- **Slicing relies on indexing**: We talk about the indices of elements in a sequence.
- Works only with **sequence types** (e.g., lists, tuples).
- **Mutable vs. Immutable**: 
  - Mutable sequence types allow data extraction and assignment using slicing.
  - Immutable sequence types only allow data extraction.

### 🛠️ Example
Given a list: `one, two, three, four, five` (mutable sequence), we can:
- **Extract**: `list[0:2]` gives `one, two`.
- **Assign**: Assigning an iterable (like a tuple) to the slice, e.g., `list[0:2] = ('A', 'B')` changes it to `['A', 'B', three, four, five]`. 

## 📏 What is a Slice?
- **Slice Notation**: Uses square brackets `[]` and the format: `[start:end:step]`.
- A slice is an **object**: In Python, everything is an object, including slices! 

### 🧪 Creating a Slice Object
You can create a slice using:
```python
s = slice(start, end)
```
- Example: `s = slice(0, 2)`.

### 🚦 Start and Stop Bounds
- For `slice(i:j)`: Start at `i` (inclusive) and stop at `j` (exclusive).
- Remember: **Zero-based indexing**! 

### 📊 Effective Start and Stop Bounds
- **Independent of list**: You can create a slice without a list.
- Example:
  ```python
  L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
  slice_object = slice(3, 100)
  L[slice_object]  # returns ['D', 'E', 'F']
  ```

## 🕵️ Negative Indices
- Negative indices count from the end. 
- `-1` is the last element. 
- Example: For `L`:
  - Slice `[-3:-1]` returns `['D', 'E']`.

## ⚙️ Step Value
- The third argument in slicing, also called **stride**.
- Defaults to **1** if not specified.

### 📊 Example of Slicing with Steps
Given a sequence:
- Slice `L[0:6:2]` returns `['A', 'C', 'E']`.

### 🎯 Important Notes
- Slices are defined independently of the sequence.
- Can create a slice and then apply it to any sequence.

## 🔄 Transforming Slices
- The effective indices of a slice depend on the sequence length:
  - If `I > length`, it adjusts to `length`.
  - If `I < 0`, it transforms to `length + I`.
  
### 📉 Example
- `L = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`
  - Slice `slice(-10, 3)` transforms to `slice(0, 3)`.

## ⚖️ Equivalent Ranges
- Any slice has an equivalent range defined by the sequence length.
- Example:
  - For `L` of length 10, `slice(0, 100)` is effectively `slice(0, 10)`.

## 🚧 Practical Takeaways
- Slicing defines a sequence of indices for extracting elements.
- Understanding how slicing interacts with sequence length is crucial.

# Extended Slicing Transformations 📚

## Overview of Transformations
When working with **extended slicing**, the behavior changes based on whether the slice **step** (K) is **positive** or **negative**. Let's break this down into two sections.

### 1. Positive Step (K > 0) 🚀

- **Technical Definition**: We slice from **I** up to, but not including **J**, in steps of **K**.
- **Visualization**: Think of it as:
  - \( I, I + K, I + 2K, I + 3K, \ldots \) until reaching **J** (excluding **J**).

#### Replacement Rules for Positive K:
- If **J** is greater than the sequence's length, it's replaced with the length of the sequence.
  - Example: From `0` to `100` in steps of `2` becomes `0` to `6` (length of sequence).

- If **I** and **J** are negative:
  - Replace **I** with `max(0, length + I)` and **J** with `max(0, length + J)`.

  - Example:
    - Slice: `-10` to `100` in steps of `2` becomes `0` to `6`.
    - Slice: `-5` to `100` becomes `1` to `6`.

- **Omitting I or J**:
  - If **I** is omitted, it's replaced with `0`.
  - If **J** is omitted, it's replaced with the sequence's length.

---

### 2. Negative Step (K < 0) ⏳

#### Rules for Negative K:
- **Indices Calculation**: We still follow:
  - \( I, I + K, I + 2K, I + 3K \)
  - But now we stop once we go beyond **J**.

#### Replacement Rules for Negative K:
- If **I** or **J** exceeds the sequence length:
  - Replace **I** with `length - 1`.
  - Example: From `5` to `2` in steps of `-1` results in `5, 4, 3, 2`.

- If **I** and **J** are negative:
  - Replace with:
    - **I**: `max(1, length + I)`
    - **J**: `max(-1, length + J)`

  - Example:
    - Slice: From `5` to `-2` becomes `5, 4`.
    - Slice: From `-2` to `-5` becomes `4, 1`.

## Summary of Rules for Slicing

| Condition | Positive K Rules | Negative K Rules |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **I > Length** | Replace with length | Replace with length - 1 |
| **J > Length** | Replace with length | Replace with length - 1 |
| **I < 0** | Replace with `max(0, length + I)` | Replace with `max(1, length + I)` |
| **J < 0** | Replace with `max(0, length + J)` | Replace with `max(-1, length + J)` |
| **Omitting I** | Replace with `0` | Replace with `length - 1` |
| **Omitting J** | Replace with length | Replace with `-1` |

## Examples 📊
- **Regular Slice**:
  - `-10 to 10` in steps of `1`:  
    ➜ **Transformed**: `0 to 6`  

- **Negative Slice**:
  - `10 to -10` in steps of `-1`:  
    ➜ **Transformed**: `5 to -1`  

### Empty Slices 🚫
- **Example of Mistake**: 
  - Slice: `3 to -1` in steps of `-1`:
    - Equivalent range: `3 to 5` (empty slice).

- **Careful with Extended Slicing!** 🔍

---

## Using Slice Objects

- The **Slice object** has a method called **`indices`** that returns the equivalent range for any slice.
- **Creating a Slice Object**:
  - Syntax: `slice(start, stop, step)`

### Example:
- For `slice(10, -5, -1)` with a sequence of length `6`:
  - Returns: `start = 5, stop = 1, step = -1`.

- **Generating the Range**:
  - Can unpack the tuple returned by **`indices`** directly into the range function.

## Final Notes 📝
- Always remember to consider the sequence's length when slicing!
- Extended slicing can be tricky; practice with various examples to solidify your understanding. 💡
