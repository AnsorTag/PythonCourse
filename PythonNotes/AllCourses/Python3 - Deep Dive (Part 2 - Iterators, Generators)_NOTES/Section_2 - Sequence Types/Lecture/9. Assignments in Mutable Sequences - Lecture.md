coding lesson notes: [[9. Assignments in Mutable Sequences - Code]]

---
## 1. Indexing and Slicing Basics üîç

- **Indexing**: Access elements using square brackets, e.g., `L[i]`.
- **Slicing**: Retrieve a portion of the sequence. 
- **Extended Slicing**: When the step value \( k \) is not equal to one (e.g., `L[start:end:step]`).

## 2. Assignment via Slicing üîÑ

### Mutable Sequences

- Mutable sequences (like lists) support assignment through specific indices and slices.
- **Example**:  
  ```python
  L[0] = 100  # Changes the first element of L.
  ```

### Slicing Assignments

- The value assigned via slicing must be an **iterable** (not limited to sequence types).
- **Example**: Assigning a tuple to a slice:
  ```python
  L[1:3] = (10, 20, 30)  # Replaces elements 2 and 3 with 10, 20, 30.
  ```

## 3. Replacement Using Slicing üîÑ

### Regular Slices

- For regular slices (no step value), the iterable doesn‚Äôt need to be the same length as the slice.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  L[1:3] = (10, 20)  # L becomes [1, 10, 20, 4, 5]
  ```

### Extended Slices

- For extended slices, the iterable must have the same length as the slice.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  L[0:3:2] = [10, 20]  # L becomes [10, 2, 20, 4, 5]
  ```

## 4. Deleting a Slice ‚ùå

- Deleting is a special case of replacement where we assign an **empty iterable**.
- Only works with **standard slicing**.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  L[1:3] = []  # L becomes [1, 4, 5]
  ```

## 5. Inserting Using Slicing ‚ûï 

- Create an **empty slice** on the left and assign a **non-empty iterable** on the right.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  L[1:1] = 'ABC'  # L becomes [1, 'A', 'B', 'C', 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

## Conclusion üéâ

- We‚Äôve covered how to mutate mutable sequences using slicing:
  - Replacing elements with iterables.
  - Deleting slices by assigning an empty iterable.
  - Inserting elements using empty slices.
