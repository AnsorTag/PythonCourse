coding lesson notes: [[8. In-Place Concatenation and Repetition - Code]]

---
## 🔗 Concatenation

Concatenation is performed using the **plus operator** (`+`), allowing us to combine sequences.

### Example with Lists

- **List L1**: `[1, 2, 3]` (Memory Address: `some_address`)
- **List L2**: `[4, 5, 6]` (Memory Address: `another_address`)

When we concatenate:

```python
L1 = L1 + L2
```

- **New L1**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- **Memory Address of L1**: Changes to a new address.

**Important**: This operation creates a **new list**, and L1 now points to this new object in memory. 🔄

### In-Place Concatenation

In-place concatenation uses the **plus-equals operator** (`+=`). 

#### Example with Lists

- **List L1**: `[1, 2, 3]` (Memory Address: `some_address`)
- **List L2**: `[4, 5, 6]` (Memory Address: `another_address`)

When we perform:

```python
L1 += L2
```

- **New L1**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- **Memory Address of L1**: **Remains the same!**

This operation **mutates** the original list without creating a new one. 🛠️

### Behavior of Immutable Types

For **immutable types** (e.g., strings, tuples):

- **Example with Tuples**:

```python
T1 = (1, 2, 3)
T2 = (4, 5, 6)
T1 += T2
```

- **Result**: `T1` is now `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`, but it points to a **new memory address**.

**Conclusion**: Immutable types do not support in-place concatenation.

## 🔁 In-Place Repetition

In-place repetition uses the **star-equals operator** (`*=`).

### Example with Lists

- **List L1**: `[1, 2, 3]`

When we perform:

```python
L1 = L1 * 2
```

- **New L1**: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
- **Memory Address**: Changes.

### In-Place Repetition with Mutable Sequences

Now, let’s see in-place repetition with the mutable list:

```python
L1 = [1, 2, 3]
L1 *= 2
```

- **New L1**: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
- **Memory Address**: **Remains the same!** 🏗️

## 🔍 Summary

- **Concatenation (`+`)** creates a new list; the memory address changes.
- **In-Place Concatenation (`+=`)** mutates the list; the memory address remains the same.
- **In-Place Repetition (`*=`)** behaves similarly for mutable lists.
- **Immutable types** do not support in-place operations as they create new objects.
