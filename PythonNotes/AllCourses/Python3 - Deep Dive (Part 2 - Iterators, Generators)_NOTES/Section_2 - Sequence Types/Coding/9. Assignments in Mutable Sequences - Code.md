## 🔄 Replacement

### Example: Simple Replacement

Let's start with a list: 
```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
To check the memory address:
```python
print(id(L))  # Prints the memory address
```

We can extract data using a slice:
```python
slice_0_to_3 = L[0:3]  # Gets the first three elements: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Assigning to a Slice
We can assign values to that slice as long as the right-hand side is an **iterable**:
```python
L[0:3] = "python"  # Replaces [1, 2, 3] with ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
```
Now, let's check:
```python
print(id(L), L)  # Memory address remains unchanged
```
- The elements `1, 2, 3` are replaced by `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`! 🎉

## 🗑️ Deletion

Deletion is a special case of replacement. We replace elements with an **empty iterable**.

### Example: Deletion

```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(id(L))  # Memory address
```

Let’s select a slice:
```python
slice_2_to_5 = L[2:5]  # Gets [3, 4, 5]
```

#### Assigning an Empty Iterable
```python
L[2:5] = []  # Deletes 3, 4, 5
print(id(L), L)  # Memory address remains unchanged
```
- Now, `L` is `[1, 2]`! 🥳

### Alternative: Using an Empty String
```python
L[2:5] = ""  # Also deletes 3, 4, 5
print(id(L), L)  # Memory address still unchanged
```
- Python treats the empty string as an iterable of length zero.

## ➕ Insertion

Insertion uses the same principle, but the slice must be **empty** on the left side.

### Example: Insertion

```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(id(L))  # Memory address
```

Let’s create an empty slice:
```python
slice_empty = L[2:2]  # Creates an empty slice
```

#### Assigning to the Empty Slice
```python
L[2:2] = (100, 500)  # Inserts (100, 500) before 3
print(id(L), L)  # Memory address remains unchanged
```
- Now, `L` is `[1, 2, 100, 500, 3, 4, 5]`. 🎊

## 🛑 Immutable Sequences

All these operations work for **mutable sequences** (like lists) but **not** for **immutable sequences** (like tuples). 

### Example: Tuple Assignment
```python
T = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
T[0:3] = (A, B, C)  # This won't work! Tuples do not support item assignment.
```

## 🔁 Assigning Non-Sequence Types

You can assign **any iterable**, not just sequence types, to slices. 

### Example: Using a Set
```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L[0:3] = {100, 'x', 'a'}  # Replaces [1, 2, 3]
print(id(L), L)  # Memory address remains unchanged
```
- Note: The order of elements in a set is not guaranteed! ❗

## 📏 Extended Slices

You can perform replacements using extended slices, but the lengths must match.

### Example: Replacing with Extended Slices
```python
L = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
L[::2] = "abc"  # Only works if lengths match
print(id(L), L)  # Memory address remains unchanged
```
- Each element in the extended slice was replaced correctly! ✅

### Example: Mismatched Lengths
If you try to assign an iterable of a different length:
```python
L[::2] = "abcd"  # This raises a ValueError!
```
- It results in an error because the sizes don't match! ❌
