## 1. Shallow Copies

### 1.1 Using a Loop
- **Creating a List:**
  ```python
  L1 = [1, 2, 3]  # Original list
  ```
- **Copying with a Loop:**
  ```python
  L1_copy = []
  for item in L1:
      L1_copy.append(item)
  ```
- **Printing the Copies:**
  ```python
  print(L1_copy)        # Output: [1, 2, 3]
  print(id(L1))        # Memory address of L1
  print(id(L1_copy))   # Memory address of L1_copy
  ```
- **Note:** The memory addresses of `L1` and `L1_copy` are different because they are different objects.

### 1.2 List Comprehension
- **Simplified Copy:**
  ```python
  L1_copy = [item for item in L1]
  ```
- **ID Check:**
  ```python
  print(id(L1))        # Different from id(L1_copy)
  ```

### 1.3 Using the `copy` Method
- **Using Built-in Method:**
  ```python
  L1_copy = L1.copy()
  ```
- **Memory Address Check:**
  ```python
  print(id(L1))        # Different from id(L1_copy)
  ```

### 1.4 Using the `list` Function
- **Copying from an Iterable:**
  ```python
  T1 = (1, 2, 3)      # Tuple
  L1_copy = list(T1)  # Converts tuple to list
  ```

### 1.5 Tuples and Immutable Sequences
- **Immutable Copy Behavior:**
  ```python
  T2 = tuple(T1)      # Same object as T1
  print(id(T1))       # Same as id(T2)
  ```

### 1.6 Copying with Slicing
- **Using Slicing:**
  ```python
  L1 = [1, 2, 3]
  L2 = L1[:]          # Slicing creates a new object
  ```

### 1.7 Strings as Immutable
- **String Example:**
  ```python
  S1 = "python"
  S2 = str(S1)        # Same object
  ```

### 1.8 Using the Copy Module
- **Importing and Using:**
  ```python
  import copy
  L1_copy = copy.copy(L1)
  ```

## 2. Deep Copies

### 2.1 Shallow Copy Limitations
- **Example with Mutable Objects:**
  ```python
  V1 = [0, 0]        # Point 1
  V2 = [0, 0]        # Point 2
  line1 = [V1, V2]   # Line made of points
  line2 = line1.copy()  # Shallow copy
  ```
- **Modifying Elements:**
  ```python
  line1[0][0] = 100   # Affects line2 as well
  ```

### 2.2 Creating Independent Copies
- **Copying Points:**
  ```python
  line2 = [copy.copy(v) for v in line1]  # Now independent
  ```

### 2.3 Nested Structures
- **Defining a Plane:**
  ```python
  plane1 = [line1, line2]  # Nested structure
  ```

### 2.4 Deep Copy with Nested Objects
- **Using `deepcopy`:**
  ```python
  plane2 = copy.deepcopy(plane1)  # Now fully independent
  ```

## Summary
- **Shallow copies** are sufficient for simple lists but can lead to shared references in nested structures.
- **Deep copies** create completely independent copies, especially necessary for nested mutable objects.
