## 🔗 Concatenation Basics

- **Concatenation** is performed using the `+` operator.
- For example, when working with Python lists:
  ```python
  L1 = [1, 2, 3]
  L2 = [4, 5, 6]
  L3 = L1 + L2  # Creates a new list
  ```
- This creates a new list that combines both lists.

## 📍 In-Place Concatenation

- **In-Place Concatenation** uses the `+=` operator.
- **Important**: The behavior differs for mutable and immutable types.

### Example with Lists
```python
L1 = [1, 2, 3]
L2 = [4, 5, 6]
L1 += L2  # Mutates L1 in place
```
- After execution:
  - **Contents**: `L1` is now `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - **Memory Address**: The memory address of `L1` remains the same! 🔄

### Example with Tuples
- With immutable types like tuples:
```python
T1 = (1, 2, 3)
T2 = (4, 5, 6)
T1 += T2  # Creates a new tuple
```
- After execution:
  - **Contents**: `T1` is now `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`
  - **Memory Address**: The memory address of `T1` **changes**! 🏷️

## ✨ Key Points
- **Lists**: `+=` mutates the list without changing its address.
- **Tuples**: `+=` creates a new object since tuples are immutable.

## 🔁 In-Place Repetition

- **In-Place Repetition** uses the `*=` operator.

### Example with Lists
```python
L1 = [1, 2, 3]
L1 *= 2  # Repeats the list
```
- After execution:
  - **Contents**: `L1` is now `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
  - **Memory Address**: The address **changes**! 🔄

### Example with Tuples
- With immutable types:
```python
T1 = (1, 2, 3)
T1 *= 2  # Creates a new tuple
```
- After execution:
  - **Contents**: `T1` is now `(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)`
  - **Memory Address**: The address **changes**! 🏷️

## 🧪 Code Examples

Let's look at some practical examples to reinforce these concepts.

### In-Place Concatenation with Lists
```python
# Initialize lists
L1 = [1, 2, 3]
L2 = [4, 5, 6]

# Regular Concatenation
print(id(L1), L1)  # ID and contents before
L1 = L1 + L2
print(id(L1), L1)  # ID and contents after (new address)

# In-Place Concatenation
L1 = [1, 2, 3]
L1 += L2
print(id(L1), L1)  # ID and contents after (same address)
```

### In-Place Concatenation with Tuples
```python
# Initialize tuples
T1 = (1, 2, 3)
T2 = (4, 5, 6)

# Attempt in-place concatenation
print(id(T1), T1)
T1 += T2  # New object created
print(id(T1), T1)  # Different address
```

## 🔍 Summary

- In-place concatenation (`+=`) for **mutable** types (like lists) **mutates** the object without changing its address.
- For **immutable** types (like tuples), it creates a new object, changing the address.
- In-place repetition (`*=`) behaves similarly, with the same rules applying.
