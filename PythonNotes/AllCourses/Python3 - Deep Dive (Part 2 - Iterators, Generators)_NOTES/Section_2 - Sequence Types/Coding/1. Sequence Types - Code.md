## 🎯 Built-in Sequence Types

Python offers several **sequence types**:

- **Lists**: Example - `L = [10, 20, 30]`
- **Tuples**: Example - `T = (10, 20, 30)`
- **Strings**: Example - `S = "Python"`

### 🔍 Characteristics of Sequence Types:
- **Indexable**: Elements can be accessed by their position (e.g., `L[0]` for the first element).
- **Zero-based indexing**: The first element is at index `0`.
- **Iterable**: You can loop through sequences with `for` loops.

Example:
```python
for char in S:
    print(char)
```

## 🔁 Iterables vs Sequence Types

- **Sequence types** (lists, tuples, strings) have **order** and support indexing.
- **Iterables** are more general and don't guarantee order (e.g., **sets**). You can't reference elements in a set by index, and their order isn't guaranteed.

Example:
```python
S = {10, 20, 30}
for elem in S:
    print(elem)
```

### 🚨 Important Difference:
- **Sequence types** support indexing; iterables do not.

## 🔄 Mutability: Lists vs Tuples

- **Lists** are **mutable** – you can modify their elements:
    ```python
    L[0] = 100
    ```
- **Tuples** are **immutable** – you can't change their elements:
    ```python
    T[0] = 100  # ❌ Will raise an error
    ```
  However, **objects inside a tuple** (like lists) can still be mutated:
    ```python
    T = ([1, 2], 10)
    T[0][0] = 100  # ✅ This works because the list inside the tuple is mutable
    ```

## ✅ Membership Operators: `in` & `not in`

You can check if an item exists in a sequence:
```python
'a' in ['a', 'b', 'c']  # True
```

## 📏 Length of Sequences: `len()`

Works on most sequence types:
```python
len("Python")  # 6
len([1, 2, 3])  # 3
```

## 🔍 Finding Min/Max Values

You can use `min()` and `max()` for sequences **with comparable elements**:
```python
L = [10, 90, 20]
min(L)  # 10
max(L)  # 90
```

But Python cannot compare **complex** or **mixed types**:
```python
min([2 + 2j, 100])  # ❌ Raises an error
```

## ➕ Concatenation

You can concatenate sequences of the **same type**:
```python
[1, 2] + [3, 4]  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
But you **cannot** concatenate different types:
```python
[1, 2] + (3, 4)  # ❌ Raises an error
```

## 🔄 Repetition

You can repeat sequences using the `*` operator:
```python
[1, 2] * 3  # [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
"ABC" * 2   # "ABCABC"
```

## 🔎 Searching & Enumerating Sequences

- You can **find the index** of an element:
    ```python
    S = "Gnu's not Unix"
    S.index('n')  # 1 (first occurrence)
    ```

- **Enumerate** returns the index and the element together:
    ```python
    list(enumerate(S))  # [(0, 'G'), (1, 'n'), (2, 'u'), ...]
    ```

## 🧩 **Slicing Overview** 

### Introduction to Slicing 📝
- Slicing allows us to extract parts of sequences (like strings, lists) using indices.
- **Basic Syntax**: `sequence[start:end]`
  - 🟢 Start at **index 1**, stop before **index 4**:
    ```python
    s[1:4]   # Output: 'yth' 
    ```
  - We get `'yth'` because index 1 is `y`, 2 is `t`, 3 is `h`, and we stop **before** index 4.

### Practical Examples 🔧
- We can slice lists, too!  
  ```python
  list_1[0:5]   # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```
- If the **end index exceeds the length** of the sequence, Python won’t throw an error. For example:
  ```python
  s[4:1000]  # No error, returns up to the last element
  ```
  
### Omitting Start or End 🤔
- If you **omit** the start:
  ```python
  s[:4]   # Output: 'Pyth' (starts from 0)
  ```
- If you **omit** the end:
  ```python
  s[4:]   # Output: 'on' (from index 4 to end)
  ```
- If **both** are omitted, you get the **entire sequence**:
  ```python
  s[:]    # Output: 'Python'
  ```

### **Key Note:** Slicing **always** creates a **new object**!
- **Example**:
  ```python
  l2 = l[:3]
  l is l2   # False, different objects
  ```

---

## 🔄 **Negative Indexing** 
- You can **index from the end** using negative numbers.
  - `s[-1]` returns the last element, so:
    ```python
    s[-1]   # Output: 'n'
    ```

### Reversing a Sequence 🔙
- Use extended slicing for reversing:
  ```python
  s[::-1]   # Output: 'nohtyP'
  ```
- 🛑 **Common Mistake**: 
  ```python
  s[0:5:-1]   # Output: '' (empty string)
  ```
  - Because you're stepping backwards in an **invalid range**!

## ⚠️ **Caveats with Concatenation & Repetition**  
- When dealing with **mutable objects**, slicing and repetition can lead to some tricky behavior! 😅
  
### Object IDs and Repetition 🧠
- Let's consider **decimal objects**:
  ```python
  A = Decimal('10.5')
  B = Decimal('10.5')
  A is B   # False, different memory addresses
  ```
- Repetition **copies** object references:
  ```python
  l = [Decimal('10.5')]
  l2 = l * 2
  ```
  - Both elements in `l2` point to the **same object** in memory:
    ```python
    id(l2[0]) == id(l2[1])   # True
    ```

### **Mutability Issues** 🔥
- **Mutable objects**, like lists, can create **side effects**:
  ```python
  l = [[1, 2, 3]]
  l2 = l * 2   # Creates two references to the same inner list
  ```
  - Modifying `l[0]` will also affect `l2[0]` and `l2[1]`:
    ```python
    l[0][0] = 100
    l2   # Output: [[100, 2, 3], [100, 2, 3]]
    ```
  - Why? Both `l2[0]` and `l2[1]` refer to the **same list** in memory! 😵

## 🛠 **Solutions to Mutability Problems** 
- If this behavior is unwanted, you can avoid it using **copies**:
  - Shallow copies
  - Deep copies
