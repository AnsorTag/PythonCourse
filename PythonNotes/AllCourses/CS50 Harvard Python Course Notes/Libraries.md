## Libraries
- **Definition**: Libraries are collections of pre-written code that you can import and use in your projects.
- **Usage**: Python allows you to share functions or features with others as "modules".
- **Tip**: If you find yourself copying and pasting code across projects, consider creating a library or module.

Libraries:
- [[Random]]
- [[Statistics]]

## Summing Up
- **Libraries**: Extend Python’s functionality, with some being built-in and others available as third-party packages.
- **Key Points**:
  - Use `import` to bring in libraries.
  - Python’s standard library includes powerful modules like `random` and `statistics`.
  - Third-party packages can be installed using `pip`.
  - You can create your own libraries for reusability.
