coding lesson notes: [[4. Import Variants and Misconceptions - Code]]

---
## 1. Basic Imports 📦

**Example:**
```python
import math
```
- **What Happens:**
  1. Python checks if `math` is in `sys.modules` (a dictionary storing loaded modules).
  2. If not, it loads the `math` module and inserts it into `sys.modules`.
  3. The `math` module object is added to your module’s **global namespace** as a reference to the loaded module.
  4. Now you can access `math` in your code!

> **Key Concept**: The `math` symbol is added to your global namespace, and it references the same `math` object in `sys.modules`.

---

## 2. Aliasing Imports 🏷️

**Example:**
```python
import math as r_math
```
- **What Happens:**
  1. Same process as before: checks `sys.modules`, loads `math` if necessary.
  2. However, instead of `math`, the alias `r_math` is added to your global namespace.

> **Note**: `math` itself is **not** in the namespace, but `r_math` is. If you had something like `r_math = 10` before, it’s replaced by the reference to `math`.

---

## 3. Importing Specific Functions 🎯

**Example:**
```python
from math import sqrt
```
- **What Happens:**
  1. `sys.modules` is checked, the `math` module is loaded if necessary.
  2. Only the `sqrt` function is added to your global namespace, **not** the entire `math` module.

> **Watch out**: If `sqrt` already exists in your namespace (e.g. `sqrt = 10`), it will be replaced by the `math.sqrt` function.

---

## 4. Aliasing Specific Functions 🏷️🎯

**Example:**
```python
from math import sqrt as r_sqrt
```
- **What Happens:**
  1. Same as above, `math` module is loaded if necessary.
  2. However, the alias `r_sqrt` is added to your global namespace, not `sqrt`.

---

## 5. Importing Everything (Wildcard) 🌟

**Example:**
```python
from math import *
```
- **What Happens:**
  1. Loads `math` as usual.
  2. Adds **all** symbols exported by `math` into your global namespace (e.g., `pi`, `sqrt`, `sin`, etc.).

> **Caution**: The `math` symbol itself is not in the namespace. This can overwrite existing names in your namespace (e.g. if you had `pi = 3.14`, it will now refer to `math.pi`).

---

## 6. Common Misconceptions 🚫

- **Myth**: 
  "Using `from math import sqrt` is more efficient because it doesn't load the whole module."
  
  **Reality**: This is **false**. The **entire module** is still loaded into memory, only the **namespace** is affected.
  
> No matter which import method you use, Python loads the **whole module**. The difference is just in how many symbols are added to your namespace.

---

## 7. Importing from Different Libraries 🏛️

**Example:**
```python
from cmath import *  # Complex math functions
from math import *  # Real number math functions
```
- **What Happens:**
  - **Problem**: Both `cmath` and `math` have a `sqrt` function. If you import `cmath` first, its `sqrt` function will be added. But then, importing `math` will overwrite `cmath`'s `sqrt`.
  
  > **Conclusion**: Avoid using `import *` unless you’re confident about the symbols being imported to avoid overwriting functions.

---

## 8. Efficiency of Imports ⚡

- **Import Speed**: 
  There's **no meaningful efficiency difference** between:
  ```python
  import math
  math.sqrt(2)
  ```
  vs.
  ```python
  from math import sqrt
  sqrt(2)
  ```
  - The second option just avoids **one dictionary lookup**.
  
> 🏎️ Unless you're calling the function **billions of times**, the performance difference is **negligible**.

---

## 9. Best Practices ✅

- Use **aliasing** to avoid naming conflicts.
  ```python
  import math as r_math
  ```
- Avoid `import *` to prevent symbol overwriting.
- Write **readable code first**, optimize later.
  ```python
  from math import sqrt  # Clear and easy to read
  ```

> 💡 Focus on clarity! Optimization should come **only** when you identify a **real bottleneck** in your code.
