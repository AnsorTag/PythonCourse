### **Using a Dictionary** 🗂️

Let's say we create a simple **dictionary**:

```python
data_dict = {
    'key1': 100,
    'key2': 200,
    'key3': 300
}
```

This dictionary allows us to fetch values by keys, like this:

```python
value = data_dict['key1']  # Returns 100
```

However, if we don’t need to modify keys and are looking for a **lighter** and **immutable** alternative, a **Named Tuple** is a great choice!

---

### **Named Tuples vs Dictionaries** 🔄

#### Benefits of Named Tuples:
- Named Tuples are **immutable** 📏
- More **readable** and **simpler syntax** when accessing fields
- Offers **autocomplete** in most IDEs (helps prevent typos) 💻
- **Lightweight** compared to dictionaries

---

### **Creating a Named Tuple** 🏗️

We start by importing the `namedtuple` class:

```python
from collections import namedtuple
```

Now, let's define a named tuple:

```python
Data = namedtuple('Data', ['key1', 'key2', 'key3'])
```

Then, to create an instance:

```python
d1 = Data(100, 200, 300)
```

Accessing fields becomes **easy and clear**:

```python
d1.key1  # Returns 100
d1.key2  # Returns 200
```

---

### **Converting a Dictionary to a Named Tuple** 🔄

If we already have a dictionary and want to convert it into a Named Tuple, here's how:

```python
d1 = Data(*data_dict.values())
```

⚠️ **Warning:** The **order** of keys in the dictionary **must match** the field order in the Named Tuple. Otherwise, values might get assigned incorrectly!

#### **Safe Conversion: Unpacking the Dictionary**

A **safer** approach is to unpack the dictionary:

```python
d1 = Data(**data_dict)
```

This ensures that the **correct value** is assigned to each **field** regardless of the order.

---

### **Dictionary Key Order in Python** 🔍

Python guarantees **key order preservation** starting from version **3.7**. In Python **3.6**, it was an **implementation detail** but not guaranteed. Now, the insertion order is preserved! 🎉

---

### **Named Tuple with Default Values** 🛡️

Sometimes, you may have **incomplete dictionaries**. Let’s set **default values** for fields in a Named Tuple.

#### Default Setup:

```python
Data.__new__.__defaults__ = (None,) * len(Data._fields)
```

This will assign `None` to any missing fields:

```python
d1 = Data(key1=100)  # key2 and key3 will default to None
```

---

### **Converting a List of Dictionaries to Named Tuples** 🧮

Sometimes, we work with **lists of dictionaries** (e.g., database query results). We can convert these into **lists of named tuples** for **better structure** and **readability**.

#### Example:

```python
data_list = [
    {'key1': 100, 'key2': 200},
    {'key1': 150, 'key3': 300},
    {'key2': 250}
]

Data = namedtuple('Data', sorted(set().union(*data_list)))
Data.__new__.__defaults__ = (None,) * len(Data._fields)
named_tuples = [Data(**d) for d in data_list]
```

Now you have a list of Named Tuples with **default values** where necessary!

---

### **Accessing Fields Dynamically** 🔄

Named Tuples don’t support dynamic attribute access like dictionaries. But, you can use `getattr`:

```python
getattr(d1, 'key1')  # Returns 100
```

You can even set a **default**:

```python
getattr(d1, 'key4', None)  # Returns None if key4 doesn’t exist
```

---

### **Conclusion** 🎓

Named Tuples provide a more **readable** and **lightweight** alternative to dictionaries in cases where:
- **Mutability** isn't required
- You need **field-level autocompletion**
- **Immutable data** is a better fit

And remember, they can still behave similarly to dictionaries when needed, but with better readability and performance!

---

**Key Takeaways**:  
- 📋 **Dictionaries** are **mutable** and great for flexibility.
- 📏 **Named Tuples** are **immutable**, lightweight, and offer better **syntax** for certain use cases.

# PART 2

## 🎯 Objective: Converting Dictionaries into Named Tuples


### 🚀 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   We start by iterating through a list of dictionaries to convert each into a named tuple.  
   ```python
   tuple_list = []
   for dict_ in data_list:
       tuple_list.append(named_tuple(**dict_))
   ```

2. **Explanation**:  
   - Iterate through each `dict_` in the `data_list`.
   - Unpack the dictionary (`**dict_`) into keyword arguments.
   - Append it to `tuple_list`.

---

### ⚡ Example Output:
```python
# Output:
# NamedTuple(key1=1, key2=2, key3=None)
# NamedTuple(key1=3, key2=4, key3=None)
# NamedTuple(key1=5, key2=6, key3=7)
# NamedTuple(key1=None, key2=8, key3=None)
```

- **Missing fields?**  
  → Defaults to `None` if a key is missing.

---

### 🔄 Refactoring: Generalizing into a Function

We can make this process **generic** so that any list of dictionaries can be converted into a list of named tuples.

#### 🛠️ How?

- Combine all the keys from the dictionaries.  
- Generate the named tuple structure using these keys.  
- Set default values for missing fields.

#### 🧑‍💻 Function: `tupleify`
```python
from collections import namedtuple

def tupleify(dicts):
    # 1️⃣ Extract all unique keys
    keys = sorted({key for d in dicts for key in d.keys()})
    
    # 2️⃣ Create the named tuple structure
    Struct = namedtuple('Struct', keys)
    
    # 3️⃣ Set defaults to None
    Struct.__new__.__defaults__ = (None,) * len(Struct._fields)
    
    # 4️⃣ Create a list of named tuples from dictionaries
    return [Struct(**d) for d in dicts]
```

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- **Sorted keys**:  
  Alphabetically sort the keys for consistent output.
  
- **Defaults**:  
  If a field isn't present in a dictionary, it defaults to `None`.

---

### ⚙️ Testing the Function:
```python
tuple_list = tupleify(data_list)
```

- If all goes well, it should return a list of named tuples!
  
#### 📝 Note:  
  If dictionary keys aren't valid as field names for a named tuple, you can add `rename=True` to avoid errors.

---

### 🔄 Sorted Output
If you want keys in alphabetical order:
```python
keys = sorted({key for d in dicts for key in d.keys()})
```

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

- Use **named tuples** instead of dictionaries when you want to:
  - Read the same keys repeatedly.
  - Avoid modifying values frequently.
  
- Use **named tuples** instead of classes when:
  - You just need to group data and don’t need mutability.

📌 **Pro Tip**: If your class only has an `__init__` method with values—just use a named tuple! It's more efficient and you get more features out of the box.
