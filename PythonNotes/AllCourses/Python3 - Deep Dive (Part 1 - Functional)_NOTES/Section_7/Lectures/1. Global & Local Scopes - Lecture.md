coding lesson notes: [[1. Global & Local Scopes - Code]]

### üß© What is Scope?
- **Scope** refers to the context within which a variable or object is accessible. 
- **Namespace** is essentially a table that maps variable names to objects. 

**Example:**
```python
a = 10
```
- `a` is a **label** bound to the integer object `10`.
- `a` can be accessed anywhere in its scope.

### üè† Global Scope
- The **global scope** is the scope of a module or file.
- Variables defined in the global scope can be accessed throughout the module.

**Note:** There is no **truly global scope** across all modules in Python.

- **Built-in Scope**: Contains objects like `True`, `False`, `None`, and functions like `print()`. This scope is available everywhere.

**Example:**
```python
# module1.py
print(True)  # Uses built-in scope
```
- Python looks for `True` and `print()` in the **built-in scope** if they aren't found in the module scope.

### üìÇ Module Scope
- Each module has its own global scope.
- Variables in one module are not accessible in another unless explicitly imported.

**Example:**
```python
# module1.py
a = 10

def myfunc(b):
    print(a)
    print(b)
```
- `a` is accessible in `myfunc()` because `myfunc()` is in the same module.

### üèóÔ∏è Local Scope
- Each function creates its own **local scope**.
- Variables defined inside a function are local to that function.

**Example:**
```python
def myfunc(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return c
```
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are local to `myfunc()`.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Variable Lookup
- Python looks for a variable in the **current scope** first.
- If not found, it searches **enclosing scopes** (e.g., module scope, built-in scope).

**Example:**
```python
def myfunc():
    print(a)  # Looks for `a` in local scope, then module scope, then built-in scope
```

### üß™ Examples

#### Example 1: Built-in Scope
```python
# module1.py
print(True)  # Finds `True` in built-in scope
```

#### Example 2: Module Scope
```python
# module2.py
a = 10
print(a)  # `a` is found in module scope
```

#### Example 3: Local Scope
```python
# module3.py
def myfunc():
    print(a)  # Looks in local scope, then module scope
```

**Calling `myfunc()` with various arguments:**
```python
myfunc(300)  # `B` is local and bound to 300
myfunc('A')  # `B` is local and bound to 'A'
```

### üîÑ Scope Cleanup
- After a function finishes, its local scope and bindings are cleaned up.
- **Reference Count**: The count of references to an object decreases, potentially triggering garbage collection.

**Example:**
```python
def myfunc():
    b = 300  # `b` goes out of scope after function ends
```

---

### üîç Key Takeaways
- **Scopes** determine where variables can be accessed.
- **Namespaces** manage bindings between variable names and objects.
- **Global scope** and **local scope** work together, with local scopes being nested within global scopes.

# **PART 2**

## Accessing and Modifying Global Variables from Local Scope üîÑ

### Scope Hierarchy üóÇÔ∏è

When you access a variable, Python follows a specific order to find it:

1. **Local Scope**: Python first checks if the variable exists in the local scope.
2. **Global Scope**: If not found locally, it checks the global scope.
3. **Built-in Scope**: Finally, it checks the built-in scope.

### Modifying Global Variables üìù

Let's look at modifying a global variable inside a function:

```python
a = 0

def myfunc():
    a = 100
    print(a)
```

- **Assignment**: In the example, `a = 100` is an assignment operation.
- **Compile Time**: Python determines at compile time that `a` inside `myfunc` is local, not affecting the global `a`.
- **Local Masking**: The local `a` masks the global `a`. When `print(a)` is called inside `myfunc`, it prints `100`, not `0`.

### Using the `global` Keyword üåç

To modify a global variable from within a function, use the `global` keyword:

```python
a = 0

def myfunc():
    global a
    a = 100
    print(a)
```

- **Global Declaration**: `global a` tells Python that `a` refers to the global variable.
- **Effect**: Modifying `a` within `myfunc` will affect the global `a`. After running `myfunc()`, printing `a` outside the function will show `100`.

### Compilation and Scoping Rules üõ†Ô∏è

- **Compile Time Determination**: When a function is compiled, Python decides which variables are local or global based on assignment.
- **Non-Local References**: Variables referenced but not assigned within a function are considered non-local.
- **Assignment Creates Local Scope**: Any assignment inside a function makes the variable local unless declared as global.

### Examples of Scoping

1. **Function with Non-Local Reference**

    ```python
    a = 10

    def func1():
        print(a)
    ```

    - **Output**: `10` (Uses global `a` since `a` is not assigned a value inside the function.)

2. **Function with Local Assignment**

    ```python
    def func2():
        a = 100
    ```

    - **Effect**: `a` is local to `func2` and masks the global `a`.

3. **Function with Global Declaration**

    ```python
    def func3():
        global a
        a = 100
    ```

    - **Effect**: Modifies the global `a` to `100`.

4. **Function with Local and Global Scope Issue**

    ```python
    def func4():
        a = 10
        print(a)
        a = 100
    ```

    - **Issue**: If `a` is referenced before its assignment within the function, a runtime error will occur because `a` is considered local and hasn't been assigned a value yet.
