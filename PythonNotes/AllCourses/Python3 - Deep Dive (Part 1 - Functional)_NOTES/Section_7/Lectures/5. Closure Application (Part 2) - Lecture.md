#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Closure: Counter**
- We start with a simple closure that increments a counter.
- The closure will:
  - Take an initial value.
  - Increment this value each time it's called.

```python
def counter(initial_value=0):
    def inc(increment=1):
        nonlocal initial_value
        initial_value += increment
        return initial_value
    return inc
```

üß© **Key Concepts**:
- **nonlocal**: Refers to the variable from the outer function (`initial_value` in this case).
- Each call to `inc()` will increase `initial_value` by the given increment (default is 1).

üí° **Example Usage**:
```python
counter_one = counter(0)
counter_one()  # Outputs: 1
counter_one()  # Outputs: 2
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Tracking Function Calls with Closures**
Now, we extend this to track how many times a function is called.

```python
def counter(fn):
    count = 0
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        print(f"{fn.__name__} called {count} times")
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner
```

üß© **Key Concepts**:
- We use `*args` and `**kwargs` to allow the inner function to accept any arguments and pass them to the original function.
- Each time the function `fn` is called, we increment the count and display it.

üí° **Example Usage**:
```python
@counter
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(10, 20)  # Outputs: add called 1 times
add(10, 30)  # Outputs: add called 2 times
```

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Storing Call Counts in a Global Dictionary**
Next, we want to track how many times each function has been called, storing the results in a global dictionary.

```python
counters = {}

def counter(fn):
    count = 0
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        counters[fn.__name__] = count
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner
```

üß© **Key Concepts**:
- We update the `counters` dictionary with the function name as the key and the number of calls as the value.
- This helps in tracking multiple functions.

üí° **Example Usage**:
```python
@counter
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

multiply(2, 5)  # Outputs: multiply called 1 times
multiply(3, 4)  # Outputs: multiply called 2 times
print(counters)  # Outputs: {'multiply': 2}
```

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Passing a Dictionary Instead of Using Globals**
If you don‚Äôt want to rely on a global dictionary, you can pass a dictionary to the counter function.

```python
def counter(fn, counters_dict):
    count = 0
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        counters_dict[fn.__name__] = count
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner
```

üß© **Key Concepts**:
- We pass the `counters_dict` as an argument to avoid using global variables.
- This makes the function more flexible and reusable.

üí° **Example Usage**:
```python
my_counters = {}
add = counter(add, my_counters)
multiply = counter(multiply, my_counters)

add(10, 20)
multiply(3, 5)

print(my_counters)  # Outputs: {'add': 1, 'multiply': 1}
```

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Practical Example: Factorial with Count Tracking**
Let‚Äôs apply this to a factorial function and track how many times it‚Äôs called.

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

üí° **Tracking Calls**:
```python
fact_counters = {}
factorial = counter(factorial, fact_counters)

factorial(5)  # Outputs: factorial called 1 times
factorial(6)  # Outputs: factorial called 2 times
print(fact_counters)  # Outputs: {'factorial': 2}
```

### üîë **Summary**
- Closures in Python can help us maintain state, such as a counter, across multiple function calls.
- Using **nonlocal** allows us to modify variables from the outer scope inside nested functions.
- Tracking function calls can be expanded by using a **global** dictionary or passing a dictionary to keep track of how many times a function is called.
- This concept can be further expanded to include timing or logging function execution.
