### üöÄ **Creating the Decorator (`timed`)**
- A decorator function is defined to **wrap** any other function and add additional behavior.
- We‚Äôll call our decorator `timed`.

#### Steps:
1. **Import `perf_counter`** from the `time` module:
   - Use it to track the **start** and **end** times of a function.
2. **Use `wraps` decorator** from the `functools` module:
   - Ensures the **wrapped function** retains its original metadata (name, docstring, etc.).

---

### üîç **Inner Function Setup**
- The inner function allows us to run **any function** with **any parameters**:
  - Use `*args` and `**kwargs` to handle arbitrary **positional** and **keyword** arguments.

#### How it works:
- **Start the timer** when the function begins.
- **Call the function** using `fn(*args, **kwargs)`.
- **Stop the timer** and calculate the **elapsed time**.
  
---

### üí¨ **Formatted Output**
- The goal is to create a **readable print statement** showing:
  - The **function name**.
  - The **arguments** passed.
  - The **elapsed time** for execution.

#### Steps:
1. Convert `args` and `kwargs` to **strings** (even if they‚Äôre numbers).
2. Combine `args` and `kwargs` into a **comma-separated string**.
3. **Print** the formatted message:  
   ``` 
   Function <function_name> with arguments <args> took <elapsed_time> seconds to run.
   ```

### üßÆ **Using the Decorator: Fibonacci Example**
We will apply the `timed` decorator to measure the performance of different Fibonacci calculation methods.

#### Fibonacci Sequence Basics:
1. Starts with `1, 1`.
2. Each subsequent number is the **sum** of the previous two.
   - Example: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...`

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Three Fibonacci Implementations**
1. **Recursive Method**
2. **Loop Method**
3. **Using `reduce`**

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Recursive Fibonacci**
```python
@timed
def calc_recursive_fib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    return calc_recursive_fib(n-1) + calc_recursive_fib(n-2)
```
- **Key Insight**: Recursion leads to **many repeated calculations**.
- This method is easy to write but **inefficient** due to repeated calculations.

---

#### üß™ **Example: Timing Recursive Fibonacci**
- **Input**: `fib_recursive(6)`
- **Output**:  
   - Repeated calculations for each recursive call (e.g., `fib(5)`, `fib(4)`).

##### üß† **Optimization Insight**:
- Repeated calls like `fib(4)` occur **multiple times**, which makes this approach slow as the input grows.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Loop Fibonacci**
```python
@timed
def fib_loop(n):
    a, b = 1, 1
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```
- **More efficient** than recursion, avoids recalculating the same values.

---

#### üß™ **Example: Timing Loop Fibonacci**
- **Input**: `fib_loop(30)`
- **Output**: Much faster, no redundant calculations.
  
---

### üéâ **Summary**
- **Decorators** can simplify the process of adding functionality like **timing** to functions.
- We‚Äôve explored two different ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers, showing how **efficiency** differs between **recursion** and **looping**.

---

üë®‚Äçüè´ **Next Up**: We'll explore using the `reduce` function in calculating Fibonacci numbers, continuing our comparison of efficiency.

# Part 2 üöÄ

### Returning Fibonacci with a Loop
- **Goal**: Return the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Process**: 
  - Store results in `Fibonacci_two`.
  - Use a **loop** to implement the sequence.
  
### Timing Comparison üïí
- You can **time** both recursive and loop Fibonacci implementations.
  - **Example**: For `n = 6`, loop method is **much faster** than recursion.
  
### Why is Recursion Slower? üê¢
- Recursion performs **many unnecessary calculations**.
- This can be optimized using **caching** or **memoization** (we‚Äôll learn this later).

### Reduce Function in Python üîÑ
- **Idea**: Use Python‚Äôs `reduce` function to calculate Fibonacci.
- **Why Use Reduce?**
  - It‚Äôs an alternative to looping or recursion.
  - Python has this **cool** function; let's see how it can be used.

### Example: Calculating Fibonacci with Reduce Function üí°
1. Start with **tuples** representing Fibonacci pairs (e.g., `(1, 0)`).
2. **Sum** the values to calculate the Fibonacci number.
3. **Move** first tuple element to the second position after each iteration.

---

### Step-by-Step Example üßÆ
#### For `n = 2`:
- Start with `(1, 0)`.
- Sum values to get new tuple `(1, 1)`.
- Result: Fibonacci number at index `0` is `1`.

#### For `n = 3`:
- Start with `(1, 0)`.
- After 1st iteration: `(1, 1)`.
- After 2nd iteration: `(2, 1)`.
- After 3rd iteration: `(3, 2)`.
- Result: Fibonacci number at index `0` is `3`.

---

### Generalized Formula for Reduce üìù
- Tuple: `(a, b)` becomes `(a + b, a)` in the next iteration.
- We use `reduce` to iterate this process **n times**.

---

### Implementing Fibonacci with Reduce in Python üêç
```python
from functools import reduce

def fib_reduce(n):
    initial = (1, 0) 
    fib_n = reduce(lambda prev, _: (prev[0] + prev[1], prev[0]), range(n), initial)
    return fib_n[0]
```

---

### Timing the Functions ‚è±Ô∏è
- Use the **timed decorator** to measure the performance of both **loop** and **reduce**.
- **Observation**: 
  - The **loop** is **faster** than `reduce`.
  - The performance gap increases as `n` grows.

---

### Why Not Always Use `Reduce`? ü§î
- Although `reduce` is **fancy**, it‚Äôs slower for Fibonacci.
- **Looping** might be simpler and more efficient for this case.

---

### Running Multiple Tests for Accuracy üéØ
- To get **more accurate timings**, run the function **multiple times** and calculate the **average**.
  
#### Updated Timing Code for Averaging:
```python
def timed(f, count=10):
    elapsed_total = 0
    for _ in range(count):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = f()
        elapsed_total += (time.time() - start_time)
    return elapsed_total / count
```

---

### Key Takeaways üìå
1. **Loops** are faster than **recursion** and **reduce** for Fibonacci.
2. The **reduce** function is a cool but not always efficient tool.
3. Always consider **timing** when optimizing your code, especially for repeated tasks.
4. Running multiple iterations gives a more accurate **average time**.
