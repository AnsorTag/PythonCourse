## üîπ Accessing Outer Variables

### Example 1: Simple Nesting

```python
def outer_func():
    x = "Hello"  # Local variable in outer_func
    
    def inner_func():
        print(x)  # Accesses 'x' from outer_func
    
    inner_func()  # Calling inner_func from within outer_func

outer_func()
# Output: Hello
```

### üîç Explanation:
- The variable `x` is defined inside `outer_func`.
- `inner_func` **doesn't define** its own `x`, so it looks for `x` in the **enclosing scope** (which is `outer_func`).
- When `outer_func` is called, `x` is set to `"Hello"`, and `inner_func` prints this value.

---

## üîπ Nested Functions and Multiple Levels

You can nest functions deeper, and inner functions will search through multiple enclosing scopes for variables.

### Example 2: Multi-level Nesting

```python
def outer_func():
    x = "Hello"
    
    def inner_one():
        def inner_two():
            print(x)  # Looks for 'x' in the outer_func's scope
        inner_two()
    
    inner_one()

outer_func()
# Output: Hello
```

### üîç Explanation:
- `inner_two` is inside `inner_one`, which is inside `outer_func`.
- `inner_two` still accesses `x` from `outer_func` despite being two levels deep.

---

## üîπ Local vs Non-Local Variables

Python treats variables as **local** if you assign to them inside a function, **unless** you explicitly mark them as **non-local**.

### Example 3: Local Variable Masking Outer Variable

```python
def outer_func():
    x = "Hello"  # Defined in outer_func
    
    def inner_func():
        x = "Python"  # Local to inner_func
        print(f"Inner: {x}")
    
    inner_func()
    print(f"Outer: {x}")

outer_func()
# Output:
# Inner: Python
# Outer: Hello
```

### üîç Explanation:
- `inner_func` creates its **own local `x`**, which **masks** the `x` from `outer_func`.
- Modifying the local `x` in `inner_func` does not affect the `x` in `outer_func`.

---

## üîπ Using `nonlocal` to Modify Outer Variables

To modify an outer variable from an inner function, you can use the **`nonlocal`** keyword.

### Example 4: Modifying Outer Variable with `nonlocal`

```python
def outer_func():
    x = "Hello"
    
    def inner_func():
        nonlocal x  # Referencing 'x' from outer_func
        x = "Python"
        print(f"Inner: {x}")
    
    print(f"Outer before: {x}")
    inner_func()
    print(f"Outer after: {x}")

outer_func()
# Output:
# Outer before: Hello
# Inner: Python
# Outer after: Python
```

### üîç Explanation:
- By using `nonlocal x`, `inner_func` modifies the `x` from `outer_func`.
- Without `nonlocal`, `inner_func` would create its own local `x` instead of modifying the outer one.

---

## üîπ Non-Local Scope in Multi-Level Nesting

You can declare variables as `nonlocal` even when they are defined several levels up in nested functions.

### Example 5: `nonlocal` in Multi-Level Nesting

```python
def outer_func():
    x = "Hello"
    
    def inner_one():
        nonlocal x  # Refers to 'x' from outer_func
        x = "Python"
        
        def inner_two():
            nonlocal x  # Refers to 'x' modified by inner_one
            x = "Monty"
        
        inner_two()
    
    inner_one()
    print(f"Outer: {x}")

outer_func()
# Output: Outer: Monty
```

### üîç Explanation:
- Both `inner_one` and `inner_two` modify the same `x` from `outer_func`.
- `x` is modified to `"Python"` in `inner_one`, and then to `"Monty"` in `inner_two`.

---

## üîπ Global vs Non-Local Scopes

If a variable is declared as **`global`**, Python will look for it in the **global scope**.

### Example 6: `global` vs `nonlocal`

```python
x = "Python"  # Global variable

def outer_func():
    global x  # Refers to the global 'x'
    x = "Monty"
    
    def inner_func():
        nonlocal x  # Error! No enclosing scope with 'x'
        x = "Hello"
    
    inner_func()

outer_func()
```

### ‚ùó Error Explanation:
- **`nonlocal`** can only refer to variables in **enclosing local scopes**.
- Since `x` in `outer_func` is **global**, you can't use `nonlocal` in this case. Use **`global`** instead.

---

## üåü Key Takeaways

- **Non-local variables**: Inner functions can access variables from their enclosing functions.
- **Local variables**: If a variable is **assigned** inside a function, it‚Äôs considered local unless declared **nonlocal** or **global**.
- **`nonlocal`**: Use this keyword to modify variables in **enclosing (but non-global) scopes**.
- **Global variables**: Use **`global`** to modify variables in the **global scope**.
