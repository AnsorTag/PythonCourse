In **Python 3.6**, a new implementation of dictionaries (**dict**) brought exciting improvements:  
⚡ **Faster** and more **compact** dictionaries.  
🔑 **Key ordering** is now **retained** when iterating through keys, items, or values. The insertion order is maintained!

## 🚀 Key Changes

- **Key ordering:** When you insert elements into a dictionary, their order is preserved.
- This change essentially replaces the need for `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module, which was used to maintain key order.

---

### ⚠️ Caveats

- **Python 3.6:** This feature **isn't officially guaranteed** in Python 3.6, but it works.
- **Python 3.7+:** The feature becomes **officially guaranteed**. In versions **lower than 3.6**, ordering is **not preserved**.

💡 If your code runs on Python **3.6 or higher**, you can **leverage** this feature. However, if it needs to run on older versions, you should still use `OrderedDict` to avoid breaking your code.

---

### 🔍 Version Check
Before using this feature, ensure you're running **Python 3.6 or higher**:

```python
import sys
print(sys.version_info)
```

## 👨‍💻 Demonstration

### ✅ Preserving Order

Let's create a dictionary and see how order is preserved:

```python
d = {'B': 1, 'A': 2}
print(d.items())  # Output: dict_items([('B', 1), ('A', 2)])
```

If you **add an item**, it gets placed at the **end**:

```python
d['X'] = 3
print(d.items())  # Output: dict_items([('B', 1), ('A', 2), ('X', 3)])
```

If you **delete and reinsert** a key, the key is moved to the **end**:

```python
del d['A']
d['A'] = 1
print(d.items())  # Output: dict_items([('B', 1), ('X', 3), ('A', 1)])
```

---

### ⚠️ Jupyter Notebook Quirk

- Be cautious in **Jupyter Notebooks**:  
  When simply printing a dictionary, Jupyter might **sort keys lexicographically** (alphabetically).  
  For example, displaying `d` might show: `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'X': 3}` instead of preserving the insertion order.

- **Print function**: The regular **print function** displays the dictionary with correct ordering:

```python
print(d)  # Output: {'B': 1, 'X': 3, 'A': 1}
```

## 🎯 `OrderedDict` vs Regular `dict`

**OrderedDict** has some extra methods that regular dictionaries don't. Let's see if we can mimic them using **plain `dict`** in Python 3.6+.

### 🏷️ `move_to_end()` Equivalent

To move an item to the end of the dictionary:

```python
d = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
value = d.pop('A')  # Pop key 'A'
d['A'] = value      # Add 'A' to the end
print(d)  # Output: {'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'A': 1}
```

This works as the **`move_to_end(last=True)`** method.

---

### 🔄 Reversing the Dictionary

To **reverse the order** of items:

```python
d = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
for key in reversed(d):
    print(key, d[key])  # Output: ('C', 3), ('B', 2), ('A', 1)
```

---

### 💡 Pop Operations

#### `popitem()` (Pop last item)
```python
d = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
d.popitem()  # Removes and returns the last item ('C', 3)
```

#### Pop the **first** item
```python
first_key = next(iter(d))  # Get the first key
d.pop(first_key)           # Pop the first item
```

---

## 🔄 Merging Dictionaries: `update()`

If you merge one dictionary into another using `update()`, the key order is **preserved**:

```python
d1 = {'A': 1, 'B': 200}
d2 = {'A': 100, 'D': 300, 'C': 400}
d1.update(d2)
print(d1)  # Output: {'A': 100, 'B': 200, 'D': 300, 'C': 400}
```

- **Existing keys** are replaced with the values from the second dictionary.
- **New keys** are appended at the end in the order they appear in the second dictionary.

---

## 🔄 OrderedDict Special Methods

1. **Move to End**:  
   Mimicked using the **pop and reinsert** technique.
   
2. **Pop Item (First or Last)**:  
   You can use **popitem()** for the last item and **`pop(next(iter(d)))`** for the first item.

3. **Reversed Iteration**:  
   Use **`reversed()`** with a regular dictionary to iterate in reverse order.

---

## 📜 Summary

With Python 3.6 and beyond, regular dictionaries retain insertion order, making them **as powerful** as `OrderedDict` for most use cases. However, if you need specialized methods like **`move_to_end()`** or more flexibility, you can still use **OrderedDict**.

Python's dictionaries are now more **efficient** and offer **built-in ordering**, reducing the need for extra libraries in many scenarios.
