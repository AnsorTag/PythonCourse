### What's New in Python 3.6?

Starting from Python 3.6, the **order of keyword arguments** passed to a function is **preserved**! This was introduced in **PEP 468** 🎉.

- **Note**: This has nothing to do with the new ordering of dictionaries in Python 3.6; it’s a separate improvement.
- 🔄 Make sure you're using Python 3.6 or newer!

### Example: Keyword Argument Order Preservation

In previous Python versions, the order of keyword arguments wasn't guaranteed. Let's see how this works now:

```python
def func(**kwargs):
    for item in kwargs.items():
        print(item)

# Calling the function with keyword arguments
func(b=100, a=200, y="hello", p="python")
```

🛠 **Output**:
```
('b', 100)
('a', 200)
('y', 'hello')
('p', 'python')
```

- As you can see, the **order** in which the keyword arguments were passed is maintained in the output! 🤩

---

### Why Does This Matter? 🤔

With this change, we can now leverage the order preservation in several scenarios, like **named tuples**!

### 🚀 Named Tuples with Default Values

Let’s create our own **factory function** for generating named tuples with default values, using the preserved order of keyword arguments.

#### Step 1: Import `namedtuple`
```python
from collections import namedtuple
```

#### Step 2: Define the `defaulted_named_tuple` function
```python
def defaulted_named_tuple(class_name, **fields):
    struct = namedtuple(class_name, fields.keys())  # Keys maintain their order
    struct.__new__.__defaults__ = tuple(fields.values())  # Set default values in the same order
    return struct
```

### How Does It Work? 🛠

- **`fields.keys()`**: Retrieves the field names in the **same order** they were passed.
- **`fields.values()`**: Retrieves the default values in the **same order**.

#### Example: Creating a 2D Vector
```python
# Define a 2D vector using the defaulted_named_tuple function
Vector2D = defaulted_named_tuple('Vector2D', x1=None, y1=None, x2=None, y2=None, origin_x=0, origin_y=0)

# Creating an instance
v1 = Vector2D(10, 10, 20, 20)
```

---

### 📝 What Did We Achieve?

- **Ordered Fields**: The keyword argument order is preserved:
    ```python
    Vector2D._fields  # Output: ('x1', 'y1', 'x2', 'y2', 'origin_x', 'origin_y')
    ```
- **Default Values**: Unspecified values use the defaults:
    ```python
    v1  # Output: Vector2D(x1=10, y1=10, x2=20, y2=20, origin_x=0, origin_y=0)
    ```

### Conclusion

With Python 3.6's keyword argument order preservation, you can now reliably create more flexible and readable code, especially when working with things like **named tuples**. ✨ This enhancement opens up more possibilities for simplifying code structures!
