### Introduction

From Python 3.6 onwards, you can use **underscores (`_`) in numeric literals** to separate digits for better readability. 🎉

### Why is this Useful?

Without underscores, numbers like `10000000` can be hard to read at a glance. With underscores, you can separate digits, making them easier to process, like this:

```python
# 10 million written clearly
10_000_000
```

This makes it much quicker to interpret large numbers, avoiding the need to count zeros! 👀

### How It Works with Different Numeric Types

This feature isn’t just for base-10 numbers! It works across **hexadecimal, binary, and other numeric types** too.

#### Hexadecimal Example
```python
# Hexadecimal numbers with underscores
0xA_B_C_D_E_F
# Still the same as: 0xABCDEF
```

You can use underscores to separate any part of the number, but let’s keep it reasonable. 😄

#### Binary Example
```python
# Binary number with groups of four digits
0b1100_0101_1010
```

### Restrictions ⚠️

While underscores give you flexibility, there are **some rules**:
- ❌ **No underscores at the start or end** of the number:
    ```python
    _1000  # Invalid!
    1000_  # Invalid!
    ```
- ❌ **No consecutive underscores**:
    ```python
    1__000  # Invalid!
    ```

### 🧑‍💻 String Formatting with Underscores

Python’s **string formatting** also supports underscores!

- **For integers**, it will group by **thousands**.
- **For hexadecimal numbers**, it will group every **four digits**.

#### Example for Integer Formatting
```python
# Automatically formats by thousands
format(10000000, "_")
# Output: '10_000_000'
```

#### Example for Hexadecimal Formatting
```python
# Hexadecimal number formatting with underscores
format(0xABCDE12345, "_x")
# Output: 'A_BCD_E123_45'
```

### 🔄 Underscores in String Conversion

Python supports underscores in **string literals** for conversions too! For example, you can pass a string with underscores into `int()`:

```python
# Using underscores in string-to-integer conversion
int("1_000_000")  # Output: 1000000
```

It works for binary numbers too:
```python
# Binary string with underscores
int("1_000_000", 2)  # Output: 64
```

### Conclusion

Underscores in numeric literals provide a handy way to make your code more readable, especially when working with large numbers in different bases! 🌟
