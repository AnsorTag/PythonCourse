#### 1.1. Integral Numbers
- **Integers**: Whole numbers like `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
- **Booleans**: Boolean values `True` and `False` are actually integral numbers (`1` and `0`, respectively).

#### 1.2. Non-Integral Numbers
- **Floats**: Represents real numbers with decimals, e.g., `3.14`. Floats are implemented as doubles in the underlying C language.
- **Complex Numbers**: Numbers with a real and an imaginary part, e.g., `3 + 4j`.
- **Decimals**: Used for more precise arithmetic compared to floats. They provide better control over the precision of real numbers.
- **Fractions**: Represents rational numbers, e.g., `1/3`, `2/7`. They are useful when exact precision is needed, as opposed to approximations like `0.333...`.
