## Python Type Hierarchy

### Overview
This lesson covers a subset of the Python type hierarchy, particularly focusing on numbers, collections, callables, and some unique singleton objects. We'll explore these categories in detail throughout the course.

### 1. [[Numbers]]
Numbers in Python can be categorized into **integral** and **non-integral** numbers.

### 2. [[Collections]]
Collections in Python are categorized into sequences, sets, and mappings.

### 3. [[Callables]]
Callables are objects that can be invoked or called like functions.

### 4. [[Singleton Objects]]
These are unique objects that have a single instance throughout a Python program.
