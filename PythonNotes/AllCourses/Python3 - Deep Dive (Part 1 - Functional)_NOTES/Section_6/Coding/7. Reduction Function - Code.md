### üìù **Creating a Custom `reduce()` Function for Sequences**

We‚Äôll start by writing our own `reduce()` function, but it will **only work for sequence types** (like lists) because we need to **index** elements to access them. Although, Python‚Äôs built-in `reduce()` works for **any iterable**, we‚Äôll explore that later.

### üìã **Example Sequence:**

Let's start with a list:
```python
L = [5, 8, 6, 10, 9]
```

We want to **reduce this list** to a single value, which could be:
- **Minimum**
- **Maximum**
- **Sum**
- **Product**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step 1: Max Function Using Lambda**

First, let's create a lambda function to find the maximum of two values:
```python
max_fn = lambda x, y: x if x > y else y
```
- Try it out: 
  ```python
  max_fn(3, 4)  # Output: 4
  max_fn(10, 2)  # Output: 10
  ```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step 2: Create the `max_sequence` Function**

Now, we‚Äôll write a `max_sequence()` function that works like `reduce()` to find the maximum value of a sequence:
```python
def max_sequence(seq):
    result = seq[0]  # Start with the first element
    for x in seq[1:]:  # Iterate from the second element onwards
        result = max_fn(result, x)  # Find max at each step
    return result
```
- Use it: 
  ```python
  max_sequence(L)  # Output: 10
  ```

---

### üîÑ **Step 3: Min and Sum Functions**

Similarly, we can write:
- **Minimum Function:**
  ```python
  min_fn = lambda a, b: a if a < b else b
  ```
  Modify `max_sequence()` to create `min_sequence()` by changing `max_fn` to `min_fn`.

- **Sum Function:**
  ```python
  add_fn = lambda a, b: a + b
  ```
  Create `add_sequence()` by modifying the function and using `add_fn`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Step 4: Making the Function Generic (`_reduce`)**

We can generalize the above code into a `reduce` function:
```python
def _reduce(fn, seq):
    result = seq[0]
    for x in seq[1:]:
        result = fn(result, x)
    return result
```
Now you can use any function (`max_fn`, `min_fn`, `add_fn`):
```python
_reduce(max_fn, L)  # Output: 10
_reduce(min_fn, L)  # Output: 5
_reduce(add_fn, L)  # Output: 38
```

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Exploring Python's Built-In `reduce()`**

Python‚Äôs built-in `reduce()` (in `functools`) works for **any iterable**:
```python
from functools import reduce
reduce(max_fn, L)  # Output: 10
```
- It can handle sets, unlike our custom `reduce()`, which only works with sequences:
  ```python
  reduce(max_fn, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5})  # Output: 5
  ```

---

### üî• **Built-In Reduction Functions**

Some reduction operations are so common that Python has **built-in functions**:
- **Min:**
  ```python
  min(L)  # Output: 5
  ```
- **Max:**
  ```python
  max(L)  # Output: 10
  ```
- **Sum:**
  ```python
  sum(L)  # Output: 38
  ```

Other useful reduction functions:
- **Any**: Returns `True` if **any** element in an iterable is truthy:
  ```python
  any([True, False, 0, None])  # Output: True
  ```
- **All**: Returns `True` only if **all** elements are truthy:
  ```python
  all([True, 1, "Non-empty string"])  # Output: True
  ```

---

### üß† **Writing Custom Reduction Functions**

We can **write our own** versions of `any()` and `all()` by using **lambda expressions** with `reduce()`:
- **All Function Using `reduce()`**:
  ```python
  reduce(lambda a, b: bool(a) and bool(b), [True, 1, 0, None])  # Output: False
  ```
- **Any Function Using `reduce()`**:
  ```python
  reduce(lambda a, b: bool(a) or bool(b), [False, 0, "", None])  # Output: False
  ```

---

### ‚ûó **Calculating Product and Factorial with `reduce()`**

Since Python doesn‚Äôt have a built-in product function, we can write one:
- **Product Function**:
  ```python
  reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, L)  # Output: 21600
  ```
  - Example with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
    ```python
    reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # Output: 24
    ```

- **Factorial Calculation**:
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      return reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, range(1, n + 1))
  ```
  - Example: `factorial(5)` returns `120`.

---

### üí° **Using an Initial Value in `reduce()`**

The `reduce()` function can also take an **initial value**:
- Here‚Äôs how it works:
  ```python
  def _reduce(fn, seq, initial=None):
      result = initial if initial is not None else seq[0]
      for x in seq[1:] if initial is None else seq:
          result = fn(result, x)
      return result
  ```

- Example:
  ```python
  _reduce(add_fn, L, 0)  # Output: 38
  ```

The **initial value** is added before the sequence:
```python
_reduce(add_fn, L, 100)  # Output: 138
```

---
