### üîç **Overview**
A common mistake in Python occurs when using mutable types (e.g., lists or dictionaries) as default values for function parameters. This can cause unexpected behavior, especially when the mutable object is modified inside the function. 

Let's explore this problem in detail and how to avoid it.

---

### ‚ùó **Scenario: Adding Items to a Grocery List**

We start by creating a function that adds items to a grocery list. We'll pass the list and other necessary information, such as the name of the item, quantity, and unit.

```python
def add_item(name, quantity, unit, grocery_list):
    grocery_list.append(f'{name}: {quantity} {unit}')
```

Since **`grocery_list`** is mutable, we don't need to return it. However, this can lead to subtle issues when using mutable default values.

---

### üõë **Problem with Mutable Defaults**

Let's modify the function to automatically create a new grocery list if one isn't provided:

```python
def add_item(name, quantity, unit, grocery_list=[]):
    grocery_list.append(f'{name}: {quantity} {unit}')
    return grocery_list
```

The intent here is to create a new list each time **`add_item`** is called without a **`grocery_list`** argument. However, Python evaluates the default value **once** when the function is defined, not each time the function is called.

This means **the same list** will be reused across multiple calls, causing unexpected behavior:

#### üßë‚Äçüç≥ **Example:**

```python
store1 = add_item('Bananas', 2, 'units')
store2 = add_item('Milk', 1, 'liters')
```

```python
# store1 and store2 both contain: ['Bananas: 2 units', 'Milk: 1 liters']
```

Both stores end up with the same list!

---

### ‚úÖ **Solution: Use `None` as the Default**

To fix this, use `None` as the default value and initialize the list inside the function:

```python
def add_item(name, quantity, unit, grocery_list=None):
    if grocery_list is None:
        grocery_list = []
    grocery_list.append(f'{name}: {quantity} {unit}')
    return grocery_list
```

Now each time the function is called without a **`grocery_list`**, a new list is created.

---

### üí° **Key Takeaways**
- **Do not use mutable types** (e.g., lists, dictionaries) as default values in function definitions.
- Use `None` as a placeholder for optional mutable arguments and initialize the mutable type inside the function.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Leveraging Mutable Defaults for Caching (Memoization)**

In some cases, we might **intentionally** want to use mutable defaults. A classic example is **caching** results in recursive functions like factorial.

### üî¢ **Factorial with Caching**

```python
def factorial(n, cache={}):
    if n < 1:
        return 1
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    result = n * factorial(n-1, cache=cache)
    cache[n] = result
    return result
```

In this example:
- **`cache`** is a dictionary used to store previously computed factorial values.
- Using a mutable default (a dictionary) allows us to cache the results **across multiple function calls**.

#### üßë‚Äçüíª **Example:**

```python
factorial(3)  # Calculates 3!, caches the result
factorial(3)  # Retrieves 3! from the cache
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution**
While using mutable defaults can be useful (like in caching), it can lead to hard-to-debug issues. A better approach is to use **decorators** for memoization, which we'll explore later.

---

### üîë **Final Thoughts**
- Avoid using mutable types as default values unless you fully understand the implications.
- Use `None` to safely handle optional mutable parameters.
- There are cases where mutable defaults are useful, but they should be used with caution.
