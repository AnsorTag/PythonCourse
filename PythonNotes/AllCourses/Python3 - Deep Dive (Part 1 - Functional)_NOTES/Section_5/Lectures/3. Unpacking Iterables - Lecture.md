coding lesson notes: [[3. Unpacking Iterables - Code]]

---
## 1. **Introduction to Tuples**
- **Definition:** A tuple is a collection of values, typically defined by commas.
- **Key Point:** **Commas** create tuples, not parentheses.

### Examples:
```python
# Tuple with multiple elements
1, 2, 3   # This is a tuple (1, 2, 3)

# Tuple with a single element
1,        # This is a tuple with one element (1,)

# Parentheses clarify, but are optional
(1, 2, 3) # Also a tuple (1, 2, 3)
```

### Special Case: Empty Tuple
- **Syntax:** `()` creates an empty tuple.
- **Alternative:** Use `tuple()` constructor.

## 2. **Packed Values**
- **Definition:** Packed values refer to collections of bundled elements.
- **Common Packed Types:**
  - **Tuples:** `(1, 2, 3)`
  - **Lists:** `[1, 2, 3]`
  - **Strings:** `"python"` (characters are packed)
  - **Sets:** `{1, 2, 3}`
  - **Dictionaries:** `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`

### General Rule:
- Any **iterable** in Python is considered a packed value.

---

## 3. **Unpacking Values**
- **Unpacking:** The process of splitting packed values into individual variables.

### Basic Example:
```python
a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]
# a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
```
- **Explanation:** The positions of elements on the right are assigned to the corresponding variables on the left.

### Unpacking with Different Iterables:
- **Tuple:**
  ```python
  a, b, c = (10, 20, "Hello")
  # a = 10, b = 20, c = "Hello"
  ```
- **String:**
  ```python
  x, y, z = "XYZ"
  # x = "X", y = "Y", z = "Z"
  ```

### Common Use: Variable Swapping
- **Traditional Method (with temp variable):**
  ```python
  temp = a
  a = b
  b = temp
  ```
- **Using Unpacking:**
  ```python
  a, b = b, a
  # Swaps the values of a and b directly
  ```

---

## 4. **Unpacking Sets and Dictionaries**
### Unpacking Dictionaries:
- **Behavior:** Unpacking a dictionary iterates over its keys.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  d = {"key1": 1, "key2": 2, "key3": 3}
  a, b, c = d
  # a = "key1", b = "key2", c = "key3"
  ```
- **Caution:** Dictionaries are **unordered**. The order of keys cannot be guaranteed.

### Unpacking Sets:
- **Behavior:** Like dictionaries, sets are unordered.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  s = {"p", "q", "r"}
  a, b, c = s
  # a, b, c may be any of "p", "q", or "r" in no particular order
  ```
- **Key Point:** Do not rely on any specific order when unpacking sets or dictionaries.

---

## 5. **Practical Considerations**
- **Clarity:** 
  - Unpacking can make code more concise but ensure it remains clear.
  - For complex assignments, consider splitting over multiple lines.
- **Use Cases:**
  - **Variable initialization:** Multiple variables can be initialized in a single line.
  - **Swapping:** Simplifies the process of swapping variable values.

### Summary:
- **Tuples and lists** are most commonly unpacked.
- **Unpacking** works with any iterable but be cautious with **unordered types** like dictionaries and sets.
