## Recap: Unpacking Iterables
You can unpack an iterable (like a tuple) into variables using the star expression.

Example:
```python
a, b, *c = (10, 20, 'A', 'B')
```
- `a = 10`
- `b = 20`
- `c = ['A', 'B']` (a list containing the rest of the elements)

## Star Expressions in Functions

### Basic Example: Unpacking in Functions
You can use star expressions in function definitions to capture extra positional arguments as a tuple.

Example:
```python
def func(a, b, *c):
    print(a)  # First argument
    print(b)  # Second argument
    print(c)  # Remaining arguments as a tuple

func(10, 20)  
# Output: a = 10, b = 20, c = ()
func(10, 20, 1, 2, 3)  
# Output: a = 10, b = 20, c = (1, 2, 3)
```

- If fewer than 3 arguments are provided, `c` will be an empty tuple.
- Unlike iterable unpacking, where `*` collects remaining elements into a list, here `*c` collects them into a tuple.

### Convention: Using `*args`
Itâ€™s common practice to use `*args` as the parameter name in functions. It behaves the same but is a widely accepted convention.

```python
def func(a, b, *args):
    print(a, b, args)
```

## Example: Average Function Using `*args`
Let's create a function that calculates the average of any number of arguments using `*args`.

### Step 1: Basic Setup
We define a function that prints the tuple of arguments:
```python
def avg(*args):
    print(args)

avg()  # Output: ()
avg(10, 20)  # Output: (10, 20)
```

### Step 2: Calculating the Average
We can calculate the total and count of the arguments to compute the average:
```python
def avg(*args):
    count = len(args)
    total = sum(args)
    return total / count

avg(2, 2, 4, 4)  # Output: 3.0
```

### Step 3: Handling Zero Division Error
If no arguments are provided, dividing by zero will raise an error. We can fix that using an `if` statement:
```python
def avg(*args):
    count = len(args)
    total = sum(args)
    if count == 0:
        return 0
    return total / count
```
Alternatively, we can use **short-circuiting** to eliminate the `if` statement:
```python
def avg(*args):
    count = len(args)
    total = sum(args)
    return count and total / count
```
- If `count == 0`, Python will short-circuit and return `0`.

### Step 4: Forcing At Least One Argument
You can enforce the function to require at least one argument by adding a mandatory parameter:
```python
def avg(a, *args):
    count = len(args) + 1  # +1 for 'a'
    total = sum(args) + a
    return total / count
```
- This way, calling `avg()` will raise an error if no arguments are provided.

## Unpacking Iterables into Function Parameters

### Problem: Passing a List
If you pass a list directly into a function expecting multiple arguments, Python will treat the list as a single object.

Example:
```python
def func(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

lst = [10, 20, 30]
func(lst)  # Error: func() expects 3 arguments, but received 1 (the list)
```

### Solution: Unpacking with `*`
You can unpack a list when calling the function to pass its elements as separate arguments:
```python
func(*lst)  # Output: a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
```
- Using `*lst` unpacks the list and passes each element as an individual argument.

### Example: Handling Extra Arguments with `*args`
If the list has more elements than the function parameters, you can use `*args` to capture the extras:
```python
def func(a, b, c, *args):
    print(a, b, c)
    print(args)

lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
func(*lst)  
# Output: a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
# args = (40, 50)
```

## Key Takeaways
- **Star expressions (`*args`)** can collect extra positional arguments into a tuple inside functions.
- When unpacking an iterable into function parameters, use `*` in the function call to distribute the elements.
- You can handle cases where no arguments are passed by using conditional logic (e.g., `if count == 0` or short-circuiting).
- Force a function to accept at least one argument by requiring a positional parameter before `*args`.
