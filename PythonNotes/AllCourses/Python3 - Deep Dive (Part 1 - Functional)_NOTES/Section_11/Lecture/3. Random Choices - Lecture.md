## üîç Basic Approach: Using `randrange`

If you come from languages like Java, you might think of generating a **random index** and accessing the list element using that index. Here's how:

### Steps:
1. **Import** the `random` library.
2. **Create a list**: 
    ```python
    L = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    ```
3. **Generate a random index** using `random.randrange()`:
    ```python
    random_index = random.randrange(len(L))  # from 0 to len(L)-1
    ```
4. **Access the element**:
    ```python
    random_element = L[random_index]
    ```

Run this multiple times, and you'll get different values each time! üéâ

## üêç Pythonic Approach: Using `random.choice`

Instead of manually generating an index, **Python offers a more expressive solution** with the `random.choice()` method. Here's how it works:

### Steps:
1. **Use `random.choice()`** to select an element directly:
    ```python
    random_element = random.choice(L)
    ```

This approach is cleaner and more Pythonic! ‚úÖ

## üß† Selecting Multiple Elements: Using Loops

Let's say you want to **pick multiple random elements** from the list. Here‚Äôs the manual approach:

### Steps:
1. Create an **empty list** for storing random elements:
    ```python
    randoms = []
    ```
2. **Loop** through and append random elements:
    ```python
    for _ in range(5):  # select 5 random elements
        randoms.append(L[random.randrange(len(L))])
    ```

But this is not the most efficient way...

---

## üöÄ Using List Comprehension

Instead of looping and appending, we can use a **list comprehension** to make this cleaner and more readable:

### Steps:
1. **Rewrite the loop** as a comprehension:
    ```python
    randoms = [random.choice(L) for _ in range(5)]
    ```

This approach is not only more concise but also much more **expressive**! üëç

---

## üîÑ Even Better: `random.choices`

What if we want a more optimized solution for picking multiple elements? Python has an even better function called `random.choices()`, which allows us to pick multiple items at once!

### Steps:
1. **Use `random.choices()`** and specify the number of elements:
    ```python
    randoms = random.choices(L, k=5)
    ```

This is **far more concise** and efficient than the previous methods. üèÜ

## üîÅ Selection With Replacement

A key concept in random selection is **replacement**. When selecting random elements with replacement, an element can be selected multiple times. This means our random choices may contain duplicates. Let‚Äôs demonstrate this with a smaller list:

### Example:
```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4]
randoms = random.choices(L, k=10)
print(randoms)
```

You‚Äôll notice that some elements repeat, like `2` or `1`. This is called **selection with replacement**. üí°

---

## üéö Weighted Selection

We can also control how often each element appears by using **weights**. By default, every element has equal weight. But we can change that!

### Example:
1. Set **weights**:
    ```python
    weights = [10, 1, 1]  # A is 10x more likely than B or C
    ```
2. Use `random.choices()` with weights:
    ```python
    randoms = random.choices(['A', 'B', 'C'], weights=weights, k=5)
    ```

Notice how **A appears more frequently**. This is a powerful way to control the distribution of selected elements! üéØ

---

## üìä Counting Frequencies

If we want to analyze the frequency of selected elements, we can count them using a **named tuple** and a custom function:

### Example:
1. **Create a named tuple** for frequency:
    ```python
    from collections import namedtuple
    Frequency = namedtuple('Frequency', ['count', 'percentage'])
    ```
2. **Define a function** to calculate frequency:
    ```python
    def frequency_counts(lst):
        total = len(lst)
        return {k: Frequency(lst.count(k), (lst.count(k) / total) * 100) for k in set(lst)}
    ```

Now, you can see the frequency and percentage of each element‚Äôs occurrence. üéâ

## üèÅ Conclusion (Part 1)

In this part, we explored several ways to pick random elements from a sequence, including:
- The basic `randrange()` method
- More Pythonic ways using `choice()` and `choices()`
- Advanced techniques like **weighted selection** and **frequency analysis**.

# PART 2

> ü§î **Scenario**: Timing the difference between two approaches:
> 1. Checking if a denominator is `0` **before** dividing (Look Before You Leap).
> 2. Attempting the division and **handling exceptions** (Easier to Ask Forgiveness Than Permission).

We'll also see the **performance** differences and when optimization matters.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step: Timing Two Approaches to Division

1. **Approach 1**: Check if the denominator is `0` before division.  
   - This is the "Look Before You Leap" method.
2. **Approach 2**: Try to divide and catch exceptions if they occur.  
   - This is the "Easier to Ask Forgiveness Than Permission" approach.

### Performance Setup ‚è±Ô∏è

We'll time both methods using `perf_counter` from the `time` module.

```python
from time import perf_counter
import random

# Set seed for reproducibility
random.seed(0)

# Generate a list of denominators (0s and 1s)
d_nums = random.choices([0, 1], k=10_000_000)
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Approach 1: "Look Before You Leap" (Check First)

1. **Start Timer**:
    ```python
    start = perf_counter()
    ```

2. **Loop with If-Statement**:
    ```python
    for d in d_nums:
        if d == 0:
            continue  # Skip division
        result = 100 / d  # Do the division
    ```

3. **End Timer**:
    ```python
    end = perf_counter()
    ```

4. **Calculate and Print Average Time**:
    ```python
    print(f"Avg Time: {(end - start) / len(d_nums):.15f}")
    ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Approach 2: "Ask Forgiveness" (Try & Catch)

1. **Start Timer**:
    ```python
    start = perf_counter()
    ```

2. **Loop with Try-Except**:
    ```python
    for d in d_nums:
        try:
            result = 100 / d  # Try the division
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            continue  # Skip if ZeroDivisionError occurs
    ```

3. **End Timer**:
    ```python
    end = perf_counter()
    ```

4. **Calculate and Print Average Time**:
    ```python
    print(f"Avg Time: {(end - start) / len(d_nums):.15f}")
    ```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Results: Performance Comparison üìä

When **half** the denominators are `0` and the other half are `1`:

- The **if-statement** approach runs **faster**.
- The **try-except** method takes about **3x longer**. ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## Skewing the Distribution ‚öñÔ∏è

What if `0` (division by zero) only occurs **10% of the time**?

Let's change the weight distribution:

```python
d_nums = random.choices([0, 1], weights=[1, 9], k=10_000_000)
```

Now let's **rerun** the performance tests:

- The performance difference is **negligible**.
  - Approach 1: `1.31`
  - Approach 2: `1.35`

### Takeaway üéØ

- **Performance issues** arise only when **exceptions** happen frequently. 
- In most cases, **exceptions are rare**, and both methods perform similarly.
  
---

## üîÑ Reversing the Scenario: Majority Zeros

What if we reverse the distribution? Let's make **zeros** appear **90% of the time**:

```python
d_nums = random.choices([0, 1], weights=[9, 1], k=10_000_000)
```

### Results:

- The **try-except** method becomes almost **10x slower**!
- The **if-statement** method performs much better in this case.

---

## Conclusion üöÄ

- Don't optimize **ahead of time**; only optimize when you find performance **bottlenecks**.
- Use **exceptions** sparingly in performance-critical code, especially when exceptions are **common**.
