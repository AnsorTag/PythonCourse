### 📝 Recall: `choices`
- With `random.choices`, you can select items **with replacement**, meaning you can pick more items than are in the list.
    - Example: `random.choices(['A', 'B', 'C'], k=5)` → might get repeated values like: `['A', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'A']`.

### 🎯 `random.sample()`
- Sometimes, we need to **sample without replacement** – once an item is picked, it’s not available for future selections.
    - Example: Let's take a **list** of 10 items: `L = list(range(10))`
    - Using `random.sample(L, k=5)` gives a random sample of 5 items **without repetition**.

#### ⚠️ Limitation:
- **`k` cannot be larger than the population size**.
    - Example: Sampling 11 items from a list of 10 will throw an exception:  
    `ValueError: Sample larger than population or is negative`.

### 🂠 Practical Example: Deck of Cards 🂡
Let's say we're working with a **deck of cards**, and we want to pick cards randomly.

#### 1️⃣ Suits and Ranks:
- **Suits**: `('Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts', 'Spades')`
- **Ranks**: `2-10`, plus `Jack`, `Queen`, `King`, and `Ace`

#### 🛠️ Building the Deck:
- We’ll create the full 52-card deck with a **nested loop**:
    ```python
    deck = []
    for suit in suits:
        for rank in ranks:
            deck.append(str(rank) + ' of ' + suit)
    ```

#### 🎨 Or Simplified: List Comprehension
- Clean up the deck creation with **list comprehension**:
    ```python
    deck = [str(rank) + ' of ' + suit for suit in suits for rank in ranks]
    ```

### 🃏 Sampling from the Deck
- Now, let’s **sample** cards from our deck:

#### 1️⃣ `random.choices`: **With Replacement**
- If you use `random.choices(deck, k=10)`, you might get repetitions:
    ```python
    random.choices(deck, k=40)  # Could see repeats
    ```

#### 2️⃣ `random.sample`: **Without Replacement**
- Using `random.sample(deck, k=10)` ensures **no repetitions**. Even if you draw 40 cards or the entire deck, you won’t see the same card twice:
    ```python
    random.sample(deck, k=40)  # No repeats
    ```

#### 🧮 Verifying Repeats: Using `collections.Counter`
- To check for repeats:
    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    Counter(random.choices(deck, k=40))  # May show some cards picked multiple times
    Counter(random.sample(deck, k=40))   # Every card picked once
    ```
