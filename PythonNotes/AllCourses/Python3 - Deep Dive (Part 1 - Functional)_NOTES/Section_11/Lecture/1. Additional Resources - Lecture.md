## 🐍 Python Documentation

Your top bookmark for Python should be the **official Python documentation**:
- [**Docs.python.org**](https://docs.python.org)
  
  🔑 **Tip**: Ensure you're referencing the right version of Python! For example, if you're on Python 3.6, check that you’re not accidentally reading Python 2.x docs. Python 3.6 is highly recommended (even more so than 3.5).

- **Library Reference**: This is where you'll find everything about the standard library (e.g., `namedtuple`, functions, etc.).
  
- **Language Reference**: For Python syntax and structure.

## 📝 Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

PEPs are **critical for understanding** how certain Python features were designed or why certain decisions were made.

- 📌 **PEP Index**: Located at [Python PEPs](https://python.org/dev/peps).
- PEPs may be:
  - **Finalized**: Implemented (e.g., **PEP 274** for Dictionary Comprehensions).
  - **Rejected** or **Withdrawn**: Still valuable reads as they can give insight into the thought process behind Python’s evolution.
  
### Notable PEPs:
- **PEP 8**: 🖊️ Python Style Guide – best practices for writing idiomatic Python.
- **PEP 20**: 🧘 Zen of Python – philosophical guidelines; type `import this` in your terminal to view it!
- **PEP 484**: Type Hints – dynamic typing tips and static vs dynamic typing discussions.

For release schedules:
- **PEP 468**: Python 3.6 Release.
- **PEP 537**: Python 3.7 Release.
