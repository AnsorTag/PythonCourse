## Introduction
- We’ve seen **how to time code** earlier using decorators. 🛠️
- But, sometimes, we want to time **specific code chunks**, not just functions. 🤔
- The `timeit` module is **platform-specific** (e.g., Windows, Linux) and finds the most **precise way** to time your code.
- It also turns off **garbage collection** to ensure it doesn't affect timing. 🚮
- You can even use `timeit` from the command line (check the online docs for that). 💻

## 🧰 Key Features of `timeit`
1. **Statement**: Code to be timed (passed as a Python string). 📝
2. **Number**: How many times the statement will run (not average time, total time). 🔁
   - To find average time, divide by the number of repetitions. ➗
3. **Setup**: Code that runs **once before** the statement (valid Python statement). ⏮️
4. **Globals**: Used to provide external variables, functions, or imports to `timeit`. 🌐

## 📝 Example: Importing Math Functions

### Two Ways to Import `sqrt`:
1. **Explicit**: `import math` → `math.sqrt(2)` 
   - **Clearer**, since it shows where `sqrt` came from without scrolling. 👀
2. **Implicit**: `from math import sqrt` → `sqrt(2)` 
   - **Less typing**, but you need to check where `sqrt` was imported from. 🤷‍♂️

### Timing the Import Methods:
- **Import Math**: `math.sqrt(2)`  
  - Took `0.31s` to run 1M times, including the import every time. 😕
- **Optimize with Setup**: `import math` in setup, only `math.sqrt(2)` timed.
  - Now it took `0.14s`—much faster! 🚀
- **From Math Import**: Slightly faster (`0.04s` difference), but **not significant**. ⚖️

📝 **Conclusion**: Write code the way **you prefer**, as the performance difference is **minimal** for most use cases.

## 🌐 Using Globals with `timeit`
- When timing code in **Jupyter Notebooks** or similar environments, `timeit` doesn’t have access to your variables by default. 🚧
- You can pass **globals** to `timeit` to let it access your global namespace. 🌍

### Example: Using Globals
```python
import random
L = random.choices(list("Python"), k=500)  # Create a random list of 500 characters
```
- **Reference Global Variables**: Pass the `globals()` dictionary to `timeit` to access `L`. 🗂️

---

## 🏗️ Local vs Global Scope in Functions
- Inside a function, use `locals()` for timing variables defined **within the function**. 🔍
- Globals refer to variables **outside the function**.

### Example: Timing with Locals
```python
def pick_random():
    randoms = random.choices(list("Python"), k=500)
    return timeit("random.choice(randoms)", setup="import random", locals=locals())
```
- In this case, the variable `randoms` exists only **within the function**.

---

## 🧪 Testing Function Performance
You can even time how long it takes for a **custom function** to run with `timeit`:
```python
def pick_random(L):
    return random.choice(L)
```
- When you pass **both the function and global variables**, `timeit` can access them during testing. 🧩

---

### 🔚 Conclusion
- The `timeit` module is extremely useful for **benchmarking code**.
- Use **setup** for imports and **globals/locals** to reference variables.
- Don't worry about small timing differences unless you're doing **millions of operations**.
