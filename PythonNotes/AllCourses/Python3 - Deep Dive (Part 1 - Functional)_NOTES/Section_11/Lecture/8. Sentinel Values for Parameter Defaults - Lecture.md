### The Problem with `None`
- When using `None` as a default, we face a challenge: how do we differentiate between:
  - An argument that wasn't provided at all.
  - An argument that was explicitly passed as `None`?
  
We can identify if a value is `None`, but we can't tell if it was a default or passed as an argument. üòï

### Example Function: `validate`
Let's explore this issue with a function:

```python
def validate(a=None):
    if a is not None:
        print("Argument was provided.")
    else:
        print("Argument was not provided.")
```

#### Testing the Function
1. **No Arguments**: 
   ```python
   validate()
   ```
   Output: **"Argument was not provided."** ‚úÖ

2. **With a Value**: 
   ```python
   validate(5)
   ```
   Output: **"Argument was provided."** ‚úÖ

3. **Passing `None`**: 
   ```python
   validate(None)
   ```
   Output: **"Argument was not provided."** üò±

This shows we can't differentiate if `None` was passed or if the argument was simply not provided.

### Introducing a Sentinel Value
To solve this, we can use a **sentinel value**‚Äîa unique object that indicates the argument wasn't provided. üõ°Ô∏è

#### Choosing a Sentinel Value
- Using a fixed value (like `-999` or a specific string) is risky, as users might pass it in accidentally. üò¨
- Instead, we can use an object created specifically for this purpose.

### Implementing the Sentinel
Let's create a sentinel object and use it in our function:

```python
# Sentinel object
_Sentinel = object()

def validate(a=_Sentinel):
    if a is not _Sentinel:
        print("Argument was provided.")
    else:
        print("Argument was not provided.")
```

#### Testing the Updated Function
1. **No Arguments**: 
   ```python
   validate()
   ```
   Output: **"Argument was not provided."** ‚úÖ

2. **With a Value**: 
   ```python
   validate(5)
   ```
   Output: **"Argument was provided."** ‚úÖ

3. **Passing `None`**: 
   ```python
   validate(None)
   ```
   Output: **"Argument was provided."** ‚úÖ

Now we can differentiate between not providing an argument and passing `None`.

### Keeping the Sentinel Private
To ensure that the sentinel value remains private, we can define it in the global scope with an underscore prefix (`_Sentinel`). üîí

### Alternative Approach: Dunder Defaults
We can also access the default values using the function's `__defaults__` attribute. Here's how:

```python
def validate(a=object(), b=object(), *, kw=object()):
    default_a, default_b = validate.__defaults__[:2]
    # Your logic here
```

### Expanding to Multiple Parameters
We can apply the same logic to functions with multiple parameters, including keyword-only arguments. 

### Example:
```python
def validate(a=object(), b=object(), *, kw=object()):
    if a is not default_a:
        print("Argument A was provided.")
    else:
        print("Argument A was not provided.")
    
    if b is not default_b:
        print("Argument B was provided.")
    else:
        print("Argument B was not provided.")

    if kw is not default_kw:
        print("Keyword argument was provided.")
    else:
        print("Keyword argument was not provided.")
```

### Final Testing
Let‚Äôs test the function:
1. **With all arguments**: 
   ```python
   validate(100, 200, kw=None)
   ```
   Output: 
   - "Argument A was provided." ‚úÖ
   - "Argument B was provided." ‚úÖ
   - "Keyword argument was provided." ‚úÖ

2. **Missing Argument A**: 
   ```python
   validate(b=200, kw=None)
   ```
   Output: 
   - "Argument A was not provided." ‚úÖ
   - "Argument B was provided." ‚úÖ
   - "Keyword argument was provided." ‚úÖ

3. **Only Keyword Argument**: 
   ```python
   validate(100, kw=None)
   ```
   Output: 
   - "Argument A was provided." ‚úÖ
   - "Argument B was not provided." ‚úÖ
   - "Keyword argument was not provided." ‚úÖ

## Conclusion
This method provides a safe way to set defaults for parameters in functions, allowing us to differentiate between values provided (including `None`) and those not provided at all. üöÄ
