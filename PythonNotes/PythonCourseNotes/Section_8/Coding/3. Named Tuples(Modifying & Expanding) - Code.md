## 📌 Introduction
Named tuples are **immutable** (like strings), so any modification creates a **new named tuple**. Here's how we extend or modify them!

---

## 📍 Creating Named Tuples
To create a `Point2D` named tuple:
```python
from collections import namedtuple
Point2D = namedtuple('Point2D', ['x', 'y'])

p = Point2D(10, 20)
```
- Access `x`: `p.x` or `p[0]`.
- **Immutable**: You can't change `p.x` after creation.

---

## 🔄 Modifying Named Tuples
You can’t directly change a field in a named tuple, but you can **create a new one** based on the old values.
```python
p = Point2D(p.x, 100)  # Create a new Point2D with modified x
```
- This creates a **new object** in memory with a different ID.

---

## 🏗️ Example: Modifying a Stock Named Tuple
Suppose we have a `Stock` named tuple:
```python
Stock = namedtuple('Stock', 'symbol year month day open high low close')
djia = Stock('DGA', 2021, 9, 1, 100, 110, 90, 105)
```
To modify the `close` field, we need to **recreate** the named tuple:
```python
new_stock = Stock(djia.symbol, djia.year, djia.month, djia.day, djia.open, djia.high, djia.low, 110)
```
⚠️ **Longer tuples** make this tedious!

---

## 🛠️ Faster Methods

### 🔓 Unpacking & Modifying
Using **extended unpacking**:
```python
*values, _ = djia  # Unpack all but 'close'
values.append(110)  # Add new 'close'
new_stock = Stock(*values)
```
Or simply concatenate:
```python
new_stock = Stock(*(values + [110]))
```

---

## ✂️ Slicing Tuples
You can slice:
```python
values = djia[:7]  # Get all values except 'close'
new_stock = Stock(*values, 110)  # Append new 'close'
```

---

## 🔄 `replace()` Method
The **cleanest way** to modify a field:
```python
new_stock = djia._replace(close=110, year=2022)
```
- Creates a **new named tuple** but requires less typing. The memory ID changes, but it's efficient! 💡

---

## ✨ Extending Named Tuples
You can also **extend** named tuples by adding fields. Here's how to create a `Point3D` from a `Point2D`:
```python
Point3D = namedtuple('Point3D', Point2D._fields + ('z',))
p3d = Point3D(*p, 100)  # Use existing Point2D values and add a z
```

### Adding Fields to a Stock
Let's say we want to add `previous_close` to our stock:
```python
StockXT = namedtuple('StockXT', Stock._fields + ('previous_close',))
extended_stock = StockXT(*djia, 102)
```

---

## 🎯 Summary
- Named tuples are **immutable**, so modifications create **new instances**.
- Use `.replace()` for simple, readable modifications.
- For adding fields, concatenate the `_fields` of the old named tuple and pass new values when creating the new tuple.

### ⚡ Bonus Methods:
- **Unpacking & Slicing** help when dealing with large tuples.
- **Class method** `_make()` simplifies working with iterables:
```python
Stock._make([val1, val2, ..., valN])
```
