# 🧑‍💻 Using Tuples as Data Structures in Python

## 🔸 **Intro: Quick Notes**
- **Tuples** are sequences like **lists** or **strings**.
- Parentheses `()` aren’t necessary to define a tuple—just commas `,` work!
- But ⚠️ sometimes parentheses **are required**.

---

## ✨ **Tuple Basics**

```python
a = (10, 20, 30)   # Standard tuple with parentheses
b = 10, 20, 30     # Valid tuple without parentheses
```

💡 **Key Note**: Parentheses are required when calling a **function** that expects a tuple.

```python
def print_tuple(t):
    for e in t:
        print(e)

print_tuple((10, 20, 30))  # Need parentheses when passing multiple values!
```

---

## 🔍 **Tuple Operations**
Since tuples are sequences like **lists**, you can:
1. **Access by index** ➡️ `a[0]`
2. **Slice tuples** ➡️ `a[1:3]` (Get elements from index 1 to 3-1)
3. **Iterate** ➡️ `for e in a: print(e)`

```python
a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(a[1:4])  # Slices to get (2, 3, 4)
```

### 🛠 **Tuple Unpacking**
- **Unpack values** from a tuple directly into variables.

```python
a = (10, 20, 30)
x, y, z = a    # x=10, y=20, z=30
```

#### Extended Unpacking with `*`
```python
a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x, *other, z = a   # x=1, z=5, other=[2, 3, 4]
```
💡 Use `_` for ignored values:

```python
x, *_ , z = a   # x=1, z=5, _=[2, 3, 4]
```

---

## 🔒 **Tuples are Immutable!**
- You **cannot** change the tuple's contents or add/remove elements.
  
```python
a = (10, 20, 30)
a[0] = 100   # ❌ Error! Tuples don't support assignment
```

### ⚠️ But watch out:
- **Mutable objects inside** tuples can still be changed! 🛠️
  
```python
class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
p = Point2D(10, 20)
a = (p, )

p.x = 100   # ✅ Works! Mutating the object *inside* the tuple
```

---

## 🌍 **Tuples as Data Records**

Tuples can represent **data records**, like:

```python
city = ('London', 'UK', 8780000)  # Name, Country, Population
```
Use by **convention**:
- 1st element = **City Name**
- 2nd = **Country**
- 3rd = **Population**

```python
cities = [
  ('London', 'UK', 8780000),
  ('New York', 'US', 8500000),
  ('Beijing', 'China', 21000000)
]
```

---

## 🧮 **Finding Total Population:**
### Method 1: Traditional Loop
```python
total = 0
for city in cities:
    total += city[2]  # Add population (index 2)
print(total)
```

### Method 2: Pythonic List Comprehension ✨
```python
total = sum(city[2] for city in cities)   # Cleaner, more readable
```

---

## ⚡ **Tuples vs Lists**
- **Tuples** are typically **heterogeneous** (different data types).
- **Lists** are typically **homogeneous** (similar data types).

---

## 🎯 **Summary of Tuples**
1. **Immutable** but can contain **mutable** objects.
2. Excellent for **data structures** or **records**.
3. Can be **unpacked**, **sliced**, and **iterated**.
4. Great when you want **structure** that doesn’t change.

# PART 2

### 📊 Unpacking Tuples
In Python, **tuples** can be unpacked to extract values. Here’s an example of how we can unpack a tuple:
```python
symbol, year, month, day, open_, high, low, close = record
```
> **⚠️ Note:** Use `open_` (with an underscore) instead of `open` to avoid conflict with the built-in `open()` function.

You can also unpack specific values while ignoring others:
```python
symbol, *_, close = record
```
- `symbol` and `close` are extracted.
- `_` is used to ignore the rest, which is a common Python convention.

### 🔄 Unpacking Tuples in a Loop
When iterating over a tuple in a loop, unpacking can be done directly:
```python
for city, country, population in cities:
    print(city, country, population)
```

- This extracts **city**, **country**, and **population** from each tuple in `cities` list.

#### 🚀 Using `enumerate()`
The `enumerate()` function returns both the **index** and the **value** in a tuple. Here's how you can use it:
```python
for index, city in enumerate(cities):
    print(index, city)
```
- The first element is the **index** and the second is the **value** (city).

### 🧑‍💻 Returning Tuples from Functions
Tuples are often used to return multiple values from functions:
```python
def random_shot(radius):
    random_x = uniform(-radius, radius)
    random_y = uniform(-radius, radius)
    is_in_circle = sqrt(random_x**2 + random_y**2) <= radius
    return random_x, random_y, is_in_circle
```
- This function returns the random coordinates **(x, y)** and whether the point is inside the circle (`is_in_circle`).

### 🔄 Loop Example for Pi Approximation
Here's a Python example to estimate the value of **Pi** using random shots:
```python
num_attempts = 100
count_inside = 0

for _ in range(num_attempts):
    _, _, is_in_circle = random_shot(1)
    if is_in_circle:
        count_inside += 1

pi_approx = 4 * count_inside / num_attempts
print(f"Pi is approximately {pi_approx}")
```
- **Random shots** are fired inside a square surrounding a circle.
- The **ratio** of points inside the circle helps approximate Pi.
- **F-strings** are used for formatting: `f"Pi is approximately {pi_approx}"`.

### 📈 Increasing Accuracy
To improve Pi's approximation, increase the number of shots:
```python
num_attempts = 1_000_000  # Run 1 million attempts for better accuracy
```
This provides a better estimate:
```plaintext
Pi is approximately 3.14
```

### 📌 Key Takeaways:
- **Tuple unpacking**: Simplifies extracting values from sequences.
- **`enumerate()` function**: Helps get both index and value.
- **Tuples in function returns**: Useful for returning multiple values, where the order of values matters.
- **Monte Carlo method**: A fun way to approximate Pi using random points!

🧠 **Pro Tip:** Python's underscore `_` is handy when you need to ignore values or use it as a throwaway variable.
