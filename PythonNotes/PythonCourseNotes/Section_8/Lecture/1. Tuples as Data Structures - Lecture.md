coding lesson notes: [[1. Tuples as Data Structures - Code]]

---
## 🎯 Key Concepts:
- **Tuples**, **Lists**, and **Strings** are all **sequence types**.
- Tuples are **containers**: objects that contain other objects (same with lists and strings).
  
## 📊 Tuples vs. Lists vs. Strings:
| Feature                   | Tuples                       | Lists                        | Strings                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Container**              | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes (characters only)      |
| **Order Matters**          | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        |
| **Homogeneous/ Heterogeneous** | Both possible                | Both possible                | Homogeneous (characters)      |
| **Indexable**              | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        |
| **Iterable**               | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        |
| **Mutability**             | ❌ Immutable                  | ✅ Mutable                    | ❌ Immutable                  |

## 🔍 What's Different?
- **Mutability**:
  - **Tuples** are **immutable** (fixed length/order).
  - **Lists** are **mutable** (length and order can change).
  - **Strings** are **immutable**.
  
## 📌 Important Tuple Characteristics:
1. **Fixed Length**: You can't add/remove elements after creation.
2. **Fixed Order**: The order of elements remains the same.

## 🛠️ Usage: Tuples as Data Records
- Tuples are often used as **data structures** because the **position of elements has meaning**.
  
### Example: Coordinate Pairs
- 🗺️ **Coordinates**: `(10, 20)` ➡️ First element = `x`, second element = `y`
  
### Example: Circle Definition
- 🔵 **Circle**: `(0, 0, 10)`  
  - 1st element: `x` coordinate of the center
  - 2nd element: `y` coordinate of the center
  - 3rd element: **radius**

## 🏙️ Example: City Data
- You can use tuples to represent a **city** with details like name, country, and population.

```python
city = ("London", "UK", 8.78)
```

- **Immutable**: The tuple won’t change once created, and its elements remain locked in place.

---

## 🗂️ Lists of Tuples
- **Lists of tuples** are often used for data that follows the same structure:
  - A **list** of cities where each city is represented as a **tuple**.

```python
cities = [("London", "UK", 8.78), ("New York", "USA", 8.5), ("Beijing", "China", 21)]
```

### 🎯 Example: Total Population Calculation
- Lists tend to be **homogeneous** (same type of data), making it easy to loop through and perform operations like summing population data:

```python
total_population = sum(city[2] for city in cities)
```

## 🎒 Unpacking Tuples
### Simple Unpacking:
```python
city, country, population = ("New York", "USA", 8.5)
```
- The elements of the tuple are unpacked into variables.

### Dummy Variables (Ignored Values):
- Use `_` to ignore values you don't need:
```python
city, _, population = ("Beijing", "China", 21)
```
- `_` is just a convention to indicate an ignored variable.

### Extended Unpacking:
- Useful for extracting specific parts of a tuple with many values (like stock data):
```python
ticker, year, month, day, open_price, high, low, close = record
```
