# PART 1

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Import Efficiency Misconception**
- **Misconception**: Importing specific symbols (e.g. `from module import symbol`) is more efficient than importing the entire module.
- **Reality**: Python loads the **entire module** regardless of whether specific symbols are imported.
  
---

### üß† **Example Walkthrough**
1. **Checking `sys.modules`**
   - Let's see which modules are loaded.
   ```python
   import sys
   sorted(sys.modules.keys())  # Lists loaded modules alphabetically
   ```
   - Some modules, like `math`, are **pre-loaded** in many environments like Jupyter notebooks.

2. **Test for Specific Imports**
   - Importing a specific function from a module doesn't mean the whole module isn't loaded.
   ```python
   from cmath import exp  # Importing exp from cmath
   ```

   - **Check**: Is `cmath` now part of `sys.modules`?
   ```python
   'cmath' in sys.modules  # True, entire cmath module loaded
   ```

   - **Conclusion**: The entire `cmath` module is loaded despite only importing `exp`.

---

### üåç **Global Namespace vs `sys.modules`**
- **Namespace**: Only `exp` is added to **globals**, but `cmath` is still loaded behind the scenes in `sys.modules`.
  
---

### üîÑ **Using `from module import *`**
- **Importing all symbols** into the global namespace.
   ```python
   from cmath import *  # All symbols from cmath are now in globals
   ```

- **Risk**: Overwriting symbols from different modules.
   ```python
   from math import *  # Overrides any identical symbols, e.g., math's `sin` replaces cmath's `sin`
   ```
   
- **Consequence**: Functions like `sin()` may no longer support complex numbers (since `math` only works with real numbers).

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Avoiding Conflicts with Aliases**
- Use **aliases** to avoid name conflicts:
   ```python
   from cmath import sin as c_sin
   from math import sin as r_sin
   ```

---

### ‚ö° **Module Import Efficiency**
- Importing modules **inside functions** isn't best practice but **doesn't reload** the module every time. Python checks `sys.modules` first to avoid unnecessary reloads.
  
- Example:
   ```python
   def my_func(a):
       import math  # Only adds the reference to the local namespace
       return math.sqrt(a)
   ```

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Timing and Efficiency Tests**
- **Utility Function**: Comparing timings with a named tuple.
   ```python
   from collections import namedtuple

   Timings = namedtuple('Timings', 'time1 time2 abs_diff rel_diff')

   def compare_timings(t1, t2):
       rel_diff = (t2 - t1) / t1 * 100
       return Timings(round(t1, 1), round(t2, 1), round(t2 - t1, 1), round(rel_diff, 2))
   ```

- **Testing Efficiency**: We will test efficiency further by calculating the timings of various import methods.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Takeaways**
- Importing only specific symbols doesn‚Äôt save resources; the whole module is still loaded.
- Importing inside functions is inefficient for readability, but **minimal performance hit** (just referencing the module from `sys.modules`).
- Use **aliases** to avoid namespace conflicts when importing symbols from multiple modules.

# PART 2

### üì¶ Importing the `math` Module
Let's start by importing the `math` module, which is already loaded but good practice for consistency. There's **no performance penalty** since it's not reloading the module.

```python
import math
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Test - Fully Qualified Symbol (`math.sqrt`)
1. We'll repeat calling `math.sqrt(2)` **10 million times** to measure the time it takes to call the function via its **fully qualified name** (i.e., `math.sqrt`).
   
   - Using `perf_counter` to start timing.
   - Measure the time it takes to compute `sqrt(2)` 10 million times without storing the result.

```python
from time import perf_counter

start = perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000_000):
    math.sqrt(2)
end = perf_counter()
elapsed_fully_qualified = end - start

print(f"Elapsed time (Fully Qualified): {elapsed_fully_qualified}")
```

**‚è≤Ô∏è Result:** ~2 seconds

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Test - Direct Symbol Import (`sqrt`)
Next, we'll **directly import** the `sqrt` function from the `math` module and repeat the same test.

```python
from math import sqrt

start = perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000_000):
    sqrt(2)
end = perf_counter()
elapsed_direct_symbol = end - start

print(f"Elapsed time (Direct Symbol): {elapsed_direct_symbol}")
```

**‚è≤Ô∏è Result:** ~1.66 seconds (~0.4 seconds faster) üî•

üí° **Key Insight:** Over **10 million iterations**, using a **direct symbol** import was ~**20% faster** than the fully qualified one. However, if you‚Äôre calling the function just a few times, **this difference is negligible**.

---

### üèÉ Baseline with Function Wrapper
Now, let's create a **baseline** by wrapping the `sqrt` function call inside another function. This will help us separate the cost of function calls from the actual computation.

```python
def func():
    math.sqrt(2)

start = perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000_000):
    func()
end = perf_counter()
elapsed_func_fully_qualified = end - start

print(f"Elapsed time (Function Wrapper - Fully Qualified): {elapsed_func_fully_qualified}")
```

**‚è≤Ô∏è Result:** ~3.3 seconds (~1 second slower)

Adding a **function wrapper** increases the overhead by **1 second**. Again, this is only significant for **10 million iterations**.

---

### üèÉ Function Wrapper with Direct Import
We'll repeat the function wrapper test, but this time using the **direct symbol** import (`sqrt`).

```python
from math import sqrt

def func():
    sqrt(2)

start = perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000_000):
    func()
end = perf_counter()
elapsed_func_direct_symbol = end - start

print(f"Elapsed time (Function Wrapper - Direct Symbol): {elapsed_func_direct_symbol}")
```

**‚è≤Ô∏è Result:** ~2.8 seconds üîß

The performance gap (~0.4 seconds) persists when using a **function wrapper**.

---

### üå≤ Nested Imports Inside Functions
What happens if we move the import **inside the function** and call the function 10 million times?

```python
def func():
    import math
    math.sqrt(2)

start = perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000_000):
    func()
end = perf_counter()
elapsed_nested_fully_qualified = end - start

print(f"Elapsed time (Nested Import - Fully Qualified): {elapsed_nested_fully_qualified}")
```

**‚è≤Ô∏è Result:** ~5 seconds ‚è≥

üí° **Key Insight:** Putting the `import` statement **inside the function** makes it **54% slower**. The absolute difference is ~2 seconds over 10 million iterations. For fewer calls, this difference is insignificant, but it's generally a **bad practice for readability**.

---

### üåÄ Nested Imports with Direct Symbol
Let's see what happens if we import `sqrt` inside the function:

```python
def func():
    from math import sqrt
    sqrt(2)

start = perf_counter()
for _ in range(10_000_000):
    func()
end = perf_counter()
elapsed_nested_direct_symbol = end - start

print(f"Elapsed time (Nested Import - Direct Symbol): {elapsed_nested_direct_symbol}")
```

**‚è≤Ô∏è Result:** ~10 seconds üõë

This is **much slower** than the fully qualified import! **200% slower** in fact.

---

### üìä Summary of Results

| Test                                  | Elapsed Time (s) | Performance Impact |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Fully Qualified (`math.sqrt`)          | ~2.0             | Baseline           |
| Direct Symbol Import (`sqrt`)          | ~1.66            | ~20% faster        |
| Function Wrapper (Fully Qualified)     | ~3.3             | 1 second slower    |
| Function Wrapper (Direct Symbol)       | ~2.8             | Slightly faster    |
| Nested Import (Fully Qualified)        | ~5.0             | 54% slower         |
| Nested Import (Direct Symbol)          | ~10.0            | 200% slower        |

---

### üîë Key Takeaways
1. **Direct symbol imports** can provide **small performance boosts** (20%), but only if used **repeatedly** over millions of calls.
2. **Function wrappers** add some overhead, but for fewer iterations, the impact is small.
3. **Nested imports** are significantly slower, and while they may have specific use cases, it's best to avoid them for **performance and readability** reasons.

üöÄ In general, unless you're doing **millions** of operations, the performance difference is usually **negligible**.
