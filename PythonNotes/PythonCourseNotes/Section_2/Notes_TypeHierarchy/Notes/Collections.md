#### 2.1. Sequences
Sequences can be further divided into mutable and immutable sequences.
- **Mutable Sequences**: 
  - **Lists**: Ordered collections that can be modified, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
- **Immutable Sequences**:
  - **Tuples**: Immutable version of lists, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.
  - **Strings**: Immutable sequences of characters, e.g., `"hello"`.

#### 2.2. Sets
Sets are collections of unique elements and can also be mutable or immutable.
- **Mutable Sets**: 
  - **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.
- **Immutable Sets**:
  - **Frozen Sets**: Immutable version of sets, e.g., `frozenset({1, 2, 3})`.

#### 2.3. Mappings
- **Dictionaries**: Collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{"key": "value"}`. Internally, dictionaries are similar to sets, but they store key-value pairs instead of just keys.
