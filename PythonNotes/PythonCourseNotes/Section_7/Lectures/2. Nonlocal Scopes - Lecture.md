coding lesson notes: [[2. Nonlocal Scopes - Code]]

---
### üåç Scope Recap
In Python, **scope** defines where variables and functions are accessible within the code. We've already learned about:
1. **Global scope** - accessible throughout the module.
2. **Local scope** - variables/functions defined within a function, accessible only inside it.
3. **Built-in scope** - predefined functions like `len()`, `print()`.

### üìö Introducing **Non-Local Scope**
- **Non-local scope** is related to local scope but different. It occurs when we **nest functions** (define a function within another function).
- Non-local scope allows inner functions to access variables from their **enclosing function**.

---

### üìù Nested Function Example
```python
def outer_func():
    a = 10  # Local to outer_func

    def inner_func():
        print(a)  # Accessing outer_func's variable

    inner_func()  # Calling inner_func inside outer_func
```

- When `inner_func` is called, it looks for `a` in its **local scope** but doesn't find it. Python then looks in the **enclosing scope** (in this case, `outer_func`'s scope).
- This **enclosing scope** is what we call **non-local**.

---

### üìä Scope Lookup Order (LEGB Rule)
Python follows the **LEGB rule** to search for variables:
1. **L**ocal (inner function).
2. **E**nclosing (outer function).
3. **G**lobal (module level).
4. **B**uilt-in (predefined functions).

---

### ‚ö° Modifying Global Variables with `global`
- We can modify **global variables** inside functions using the `global` keyword.

```python
a = 10  # Global variable

def outer_func():
    global a  # Refers to the global variable
    a = 1000  # Modifies global 'a'

outer_func()
print(a)  # Output: 1000
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Modifying Non-Local Variables with `nonlocal`
- To modify a variable in an **enclosing scope** (but not global), use the `nonlocal` keyword.

```python
def outer_func():
    x = "Hello"  # Local to outer_func

    def inner_func():
        nonlocal x  # Refers to 'x' in outer_func
        x = "Python"  # Modifies 'x' in outer_func

    inner_func()
    print(x)  # Output: Python

outer_func()
```

Here, the `nonlocal` keyword ensures that `x` in `outer_func` is modified, not a new local `x` in `inner_func`.

---

### üåê Example: Non-Local vs. Global
Consider the difference between modifying **non-local** and **global** variables.

```python
x = 100  # Global variable

def outer_func():
    x = "Python"  # Local to outer_func

    def inner_func():
        nonlocal x  # Refers to 'x' in outer_func
        x = "Monty"  # Modifies 'x' in outer_func

        def inner_inner_func():
            global x  # Refers to the global 'x'
            x = 500  # Modifies global 'x'

        inner_inner_func()

    inner_func()
    print(x)  # Output: Monty

outer_func()
print(x)  # Output: 500 (Global 'x' is modified)
```

- **nonlocal `x`** modifies the variable in `outer_func`.
- **global `x`** modifies the global variable `x`.

---

### üß† Key Takeaways
- **Non-local scope** occurs in nested functions and allows the inner function to access variables from the enclosing function.
- Use the **`global`** keyword to modify global variables inside functions.
- Use the **`nonlocal`** keyword to modify variables in the **enclosing scope** (i.e., in the outer function).

This is a powerful concept that helps structure code, especially when working with closures and nested functions.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Revision Tips:
- **LEGB Rule**: Always remember the order Python searches for variables!
- **Practice** using both `global` and `nonlocal` in your code to reinforce these concepts.
- **Nested Functions**: Try experimenting with nested functions and see how Python resolves variable access! 

üîÅ Keep revising this for mastery!
