# 📘 **Lecture Notes: Closures in Python**

### 🌟 **Closures & Free Variables**

1. **Definition of a Closure**:
   - A closure is formed when an **inner function** references variables from an **outer function**, even after the outer function has finished executing.
   - The combination of the function and the variables it references (free variables) creates a **closure**.

2. **Non-Local (Free) Variables**:
   - A **non-local** or **free variable** is a variable used in a function that is neither local nor global.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def outer():
         x = "Python"
         def inner():
             print(x)
         return inner
     ```
     Here, `x` is a **free variable** for `inner` because it is declared in `outer`, but referenced in `inner`.

3. **Creation Time vs. Runtime**:
   - The inner function is **created** when the outer function is called, but the **value** of free variables is **evaluated** only when the inner function is executed.

### 🛠️ **Returning Functions (Higher-Order Functions)**

1. **Returning Functions**:
   - Functions in Python can return other functions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def outer():
         x = "Python"
         def inner():
             print(x)
         return inner
     ```
     - When we call `outer()`, we get a **closure** (`inner` + its free variable `x`).

2. **Assigning the Returned Function**:
   - You can assign the returned function to a variable:
     ```python
     fn = outer()  # fn is now the closure
     fn()  # Prints "Python"
     ```

3. **Closure's Power**:
   - Even after `outer()` is finished, the **closure** retains the value of `x` through **Python's cell mechanism**.

### 🔍 **How Python Handles Free Variables**

1. **Memory Management with Cells**:
   - Python uses **cells** to manage free variables shared between an outer and inner function.
   - Instead of direct references, free variables point to a **cell** that holds the actual value.
     ```plaintext
     outer_x --> cell --> "Python"
     inner_x --> cell --> "Python"
     ```
   - This allows both `outer` and `inner` to share the same free variable (`x`).

2. **Example**:
   ```python
   def outer():
       x = "Python"
       def inner():
           print(x)
       return inner
   fn = outer()
   fn()  # Prints "Python"
   ```

### 🧩 **Introspection with Closures**

1. **Inspecting Free Variables**:
   - Python provides ways to inspect closures:
     - `__code__.co_freevars`: Shows free variable names.
     - `__closure__`: Shows cell objects and their memory addresses.
     ```python
     fn.__code__.co_freevars  # ('x',)
     fn.__closure__  # (<cell at 0x...: str object at 0x...>)
     ```

2. **Double Hop**:
   - When accessing a free variable, Python **hops twice**:
     1. First hop to the **cell**.
     2. Second hop to the **actual value** stored in memory.

---

### 🔄 **Modifying Free Variables**

1. **Changing Free Variables with `nonlocal`**:
   - You can change free variables inside the inner function using `nonlocal`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def counter():
         count = 0
         def inc():
             nonlocal count
             count += 1
             return count
         return inc
     fn = counter()
     print(fn())  # Output: 1
     print(fn())  # Output: 2
     ```

---

### 📝 **Key Takeaways**:
- A **closure** = a function + its free variables.
- **Free variables** are evaluated when the inner function is called, not when it's created.
- Python manages free variables using **cells**, allowing values to persist after the outer function has exited.
- Use `nonlocal` to modify free variables in a closure.

## 📚 Part 2: Multiple Instances of Closures

### 🔄 Multiple Instances of Closures

Every time we run a function, a new scope is created, and if that function generates a closure, a new closure is created as well. Let's break this down with an example:

```python
def counter():
    count = 0
    def inc():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inc
```

1. **Creating Closures:**
    - **`F1 = counter()`**: Calls `counter`, creates `inc` and returns it. `F1` now holds this closure.
    - **`F2 = counter()`**: Calls `counter` again, creates a new `inc` and returns it. `F2` holds this new closure.

2. **Different Memory Addresses:**
    - `F1` and `F2` do not share the same scope. Each has its own `count` with a unique memory address.
    - Calling `F1()` increases `count` for `F1`.
    - Calling `F2()` starts with `count` at 0 for `F2`.

**Example Output:**

```python
print(F1())  # Output: 1
print(F1())  # Output: 2
print(F2())  # Output: 1
print(F2())  # Output: 2
```

### 🔗 Sharing Extended Scopes

You can share extended scopes between closures:

```python
def outer():
    count = 0
    def inc1():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    def inc2():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return (inc1, inc2)
```

- **Shared Scope:** `inc1` and `inc2` share the same `count` variable.
- **Calling Functions:**

```python
f1, f2 = outer()
print(f1())  # Output: 1
print(f2())  # Output: 2
```

### 🚧 Common Pitfalls

**Problem with Closures in Loops:**

```python
adders = []
for n in range(1, 4):
    adders.append(lambda x: x + n)
```

- **Issue:** All closures refer to the same `n`, which ends up being the last value from the loop (3).
- **Outcome:**

```python
print(adders )  # Output: 13
print(adders )  # Output: 13
print(adders )  # Output: 13
```

**Explanation:**

- The `n` in the lambda functions is bound to the same cell that is updated in each iteration of the loop.
- When the lambda function is called, it looks up the current value of `n`, which is 3.

### 🔄 Correct Approach

Use default arguments to capture the value:

```python
adders = []
for n in range(1, 4):
    adders.append(lambda x, n=n: x + n)
```

- **Result:**

```python
print(adders )  # Output: 11
print(adders )  # Output: 12
print(adders )  # Output: 13
```

### 📍 Nested Closures

Closures can be nested:

```python
def incrementer(n):
    def increment(start):
        current = start
        def inc():
            nonlocal current
            current += n
            return current
        return inc
    return increment
```

**Example:**

```python
inc_by_2 = incrementer(2)(100)
print(inc_by_2())  # Output: 102
print(inc_by_2())  # Output: 104
```

- **Explanation:** `inc_by_2` holds a closure where `current` starts at 100 and increments by 2.

### 📌 Summary

- **Closures and Scopes:** Each function call creates a new scope and closure.
- **Shared Scopes:** Closures can share variables if created within the same outer scope.
- **Pitfalls:** Be careful with closures inside loops. Use default arguments to avoid common issues.
