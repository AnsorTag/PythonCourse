coding lesson notes: [[4. Decorators (Part 1) - Code]]

---
### üåü **What are Decorators?**
- **Definition**: Decorators allow us to modify the behavior of a function or class.
- **Key Point**: We've already seen decorators before, even if we didn‚Äôt call them that.
  
### üõ† **Example: Closure for Counting Function Calls**
- **Closure Example**: Used in the last video to track how many times a function was called.
- **Steps**:
  1. We had a **higher-order function** (`counter`) that took a function (e.g., `add`, `mult`, or `factorial`) as an argument.
  2. Inside `counter`, a local variable `count = 0` was initialized.
  3. We created an **inner function** that:
     - Used `nonlocal count` (important for the closure).
     - Printed how many times the function was called.
     - Called the original function `fn` using passed arguments.
  
### üîß **How it Works**:
1. **Example Function**: `add(a, b=0)` simply returns `a + b`.
2. **Decorating**: When calling `counter(add)`, it returns the **inner function** (the closure).
3. **Executing the Closure**: Calling this inner function behaves like calling `add()`, but with extra functionality (the `count` and `print`).

### üí° **Why It's Called a "Decorator"**:
- **Decorator**: A function that takes another function and adds functionality to it.
- **Example**: We wrapped `add` with `counter`, adding new behavior (tracking calls).

### üß† **How Decorators Work (Conceptually)**:
1. **Decorator Function**:
   - Takes a function as an argument.
   - Returns a **closure** that enhances the original function‚Äôs behavior.
  
2. **Closure**:
   - Accepts arbitrary arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) to keep things generic.
   - Runs some extra code (like counting or printing).
   - Calls the original function with those arguments.
   - Returns the result as if the original function was called.

### üìä **Visual Breakdown**:

1. **Outer Function**: Takes a function (e.g., `add`, `mult`) as an argument.
2. **Inner Function (Closure)**: Defined within the outer function.
   - Uses `*args` and `**kwargs` to accept any arguments.
   - Performs extra tasks (like counting or printing).
   - Calls the original function.
3. **Result**: The closure acts like the original function, but with added functionality.

### üåÄ **Python‚Äôs @ Syntax**:
- **Simplifies**: Python has a shortcut using the `@` symbol to apply decorators.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  @counter
  def add(a, b=0):
      return a + b
  ```
  This is equivalent to writing:
  ```python
  add = counter(add)
  ```

### üîç **Introspection of Decorated Functions**:
1. **Problem**: After decorating, the original function‚Äôs name, docstring, and signature get lost.
   - Example: `mult.__name__` becomes `inner` instead of `mult`.
   - Calling `help(mult)` will show the closure‚Äôs info, not the original function‚Äôs.

2. **Solution**: Python's `functools` module provides a **wraps** decorator to fix this.
   - **Usage**:
     ```python
     from functools import wraps
     
     def counter(fn):
         @wraps(fn)
         def inner(*args, **kwargs):
             # Decorator functionality (e.g., counting)
             return fn(*args, **kwargs)
         return inner
     ```

### üéØ **Key Takeaways**:
- **Decorators** modify or enhance a function‚Äôs behavior without changing the function itself.
- **Closures** help maintain state (e.g., `count`) across multiple function calls.
- **`@` Syntax** simplifies the process of applying decorators in Python.
- **Functools.wraps**: Use it to retain metadata (name, docstring, etc.) when decorating functions.

**üîñ Useful for**:
- Adding logging, counting, or timing functionality to functions.
- Enhancing existing code without modifying the original function logic.
