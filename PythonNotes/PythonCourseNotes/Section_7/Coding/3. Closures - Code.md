### 1. **Creating a Basic Closure**

1. **Define an outer function**:
   - Assign a **local variable** (`x`).
   - Define an **inner function** that accesses the variable `x`.
   - Return the inner function (closure).

2. **Example**:
   ```python
   def outer():
       x = "Hello"
       def inner():
           print(x)
       return inner
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `x` is a **non-local variable** (it's declared in `outer` but accessed in `inner`).
     - The inner function forms a closure, binding `x` to the function even after `outer` finishes.

3. **Calling the closure**:
   ```python
   fn = outer()  # `fn` is now the inner function
   fn()  # Outputs: "Hello"
   ```

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- The closure retains access to **free variables** (like `x`) even after `outer()` has completed.
- These variables are stored in a **cell object**, allowing different scopes to reference them.

### 2. **Memory Management in Closures**

- In Python, strings and integers have **interning**, meaning they may share the same memory address.
- To avoid confusion when dealing with closures and memory addresses, use mutable types like **lists**.

#### **Memory Address Example**:
```python
def outer():
    x = [1, 2, 3]
    def inner():
        print(hex(id(x)))  # Print memory address of `x`
    return inner
```
- When calling `fn = outer()`, and then `fn()`, you’ll see that `x` retains its memory address.
  
---

### 3. **Modifying Free Variables**

Closures can **modify** non-local variables using the `nonlocal` keyword.

#### **Example**:
```python
def outer():
    count = 0
    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inner
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `nonlocal count` tells Python that `count` in `inner` refers to the same `count` in `outer`.
  - This creates a **shared scope** between `outer()` and `inner()`.

#### **Result**:
```python
fn = outer()
print(fn())  # 1
print(fn())  # 2
```

#### **Key Points**:
- When `count` is incremented, the **cell object** that holds `count` is updated.
- The memory address changes as the value of `count` is updated.

---

### 4. **Multiple Closures Modifying the Same Variable**

Two closures can share the same variable.

#### **Example**:
```python
def outer():
    count = 0
    def inc1():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    def inc2():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inc1, inc2
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Both `inc1` and `inc2` share the **same `count` variable** because they were defined in the same scope.

#### **Result**:
```python
fn1, fn2 = outer()
print(fn1())  # 1
print(fn2())  # 2
```

#### **Key Point**:
- Both functions share the same **cell object**, so updating `count` in one function affects the other.

---

### 5. **Different Scopes = Different Closures**

If closures are created in **different scopes**, they will not share variables.

#### **Example**:
```python
def power(n):
    def inner(x):
        return x ** n
    return inner
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Every time `power()` is called, a new scope is created, resulting in a different closure each time.

#### **Result**:
```python
square = power(2)
cube = power(3)

print(square(5))  # 25
print(cube(5))    # 125
```
- **Key Point**: Each closure has its own **independent variable** (`n`), so they do not interfere with each other.

---

### 🔑 **Summary of Closures**:

1. **Closures retain access** to non-local variables even after the outer function completes.
2. **Free variables** are stored in a **cell object**, enabling different functions to reference the same object.
3. Closures can **modify non-local variables** using `nonlocal`.
4. Multiple closures defined in the same scope share the **same variable**.
5. **Different scopes** create independent closures that don't share variables.

## 🧠 **Context: Shared Labels Between Scopes**

- When working with closures, you may **inadvertently create shared labels between scopes**, leading to unexpected behavior.
- 🛑 **Important:** If code is run directly in the module, closures **may not be created** because of shared labels. 

### Example:

```python
def adder(n):
    def inner(x):
        return x + n
    return inner
```

- 💡 This creates a closure that captures the variable `n` and uses it in the inner function.
  
---

## 🛠️ **Creating Closures Within Functions**
Closures are more apparent when defined inside a function.

### Example:

```python
add_1 = adder(1)
add_2 = adder(2)
add_3 = adder(3)
```

- Each closure has its **own scope** and refers to a **different `n`** value.
- These scopes are **independent**, so the variables don't interfere with each other.

### 🔬 **Check Closures:**

```python
add_1.__closure__   # Shows the reference to the captured variable
```

- 🔍 **Result:** We see different cells for different closures. 

---

## 🔄 **Creating Closures in a Loop:**

If you try to create closures inside a loop, you might end up **reusing the same variable reference**.

### Example:

```python
adders = []
for n in range(1, 4):
    adders.append(lambda x: x + n)
```

- 🚨 **Problem:** Here, the same `n` is shared across all closures. This will lead to unexpected results when you call any of the functions in `adders`. 
    - Each closure ends up **using the last value** of `n` (in this case, `n=3`).

### ❌ Example of the Bug:

```python
adders   # Expected 11, but returns 13
adders   # Expected 12, but returns 13
```

- 💡 This happens because the loop **modifies `n`**, and all closures reference the **same memory location**.

---

## 🛠️ **Fixing the Bug: Using Defaults**

To fix this issue, capture the **current value of `n`** at function creation time using **default arguments**.

### 🧑‍🔧 Solution:

```python
adders = []
for n in range(1, 4):
    adders.append(lambda x, y=n: x + y)
```

- ⚙️ **Why this works:** The value of `n` is assigned to `y` when the function is **created**, not when it is **called**. So each lambda now has its own distinct `y`.

### ✅ Example:

```python
adders   # Returns 11
adders   # Returns 12
adders   # Returns 13
```

- 📌 **No closures here**, just plain functions with default arguments!

---

## ⚠️ **Key Takeaways:**

- **Closures**: Functions that capture free variables from their environment.
- **Bug**: Reusing variables in loops can lead to shared references, causing unexpected results.
- **Fix**: Use **default arguments** to capture values at **creation time** rather than call time.
