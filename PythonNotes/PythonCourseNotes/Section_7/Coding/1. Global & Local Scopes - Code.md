## 📚 Understanding Modules

- When running a Jupyter notebook, it's actually running **inside a module**. 
- 📌 **Example**: 
  - Typing `A = 10` creates a **global variable** within the notebook (module).
  - This is no different from typing `A = 10` in any other Python module or IDE (e.g., PyCharm).

```python
A = 10
print(A)  # Output: 10
```

- **Key Point**: The notebook behaves like a Python module. The global variable `A` is scoped to the entire notebook.

---

## 🧠 Local Variables in Functions

- When defining a function, variables within the function are **local** to that function.
- 📌 **Example**: Function with local variables

```python
def myfunc(N):
    C = N ** 2  # Local variable C
    return C
```

- **`C`** is a local variable, only accessible inside `myfunc`. The parameter **`N`** is also local to the function.

---

## 🌐 Accessing Global Variables Inside Functions

- Functions can access **global variables** without issues, as long as there's no assignment.
  
  📌 **Example**:

```python
A = 10

def myfunc(N):
    print("Global A:", A)  # Access global A
    C = A ** N
    return C

myfunc(2)  # Output: Global A: 10, Returns 100
```

  - **Explanation**: Since there's no assignment to `A`, the function retrieves the global value.

---

## ❗ Masking Global Variables with Local Variables

- If you assign to a global variable **inside a function** without declaring it as global, Python creates a **new local variable**.

  📌 **Example**:

```python
A = 10

def myfunc(N):
    A = 20  # Local variable A (shadows global A)
    C = A ** N
    return C

myfunc(2)  # Returns 400, but A is still 10 globally
print(A)   # Output: 10
```

  - **Key Point**: The global `A` remains unchanged because `A = 20` created a local variable.

---

## 🌐 Modifying Global Variables with `global` Keyword

- To modify a **global variable** inside a function, you must use the **`global`** keyword.

  📌 **Example**:

```python
A = 10

def myfunc(N):
    global A
    A = 20
    C = A ** N
    return C

myfunc(2)  # Returns 400
print(A)   # Output: 20
```

  - **Key Point**: Using `global A` ensures that the global variable is updated within the function.

---

## 🆕 Creating Global Variables Inside a Function

- You can **create** global variables inside functions using the `global` keyword, even if they don’t exist beforehand!

  📌 **Example**:

```python
def myfunc():
    global var
    var = "Hello, World!"

myfunc()
print(var)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

  - **Key Point**: The global variable `var` is created inside the function and accessible after the function runs.

---

## ⚠️ `global` Keyword Behavior

- **Beware**: When you use `global` in a function, all occurrences of that variable within the function are considered global.

  📌 **Example**:

```python
A = 10

def myfunc():
    global A
    A = "Hello"

myfunc()
print(A)  # Output: Hello
```

---

## 🛠️ Local vs Global at Compile-Time

- Python **determines the scope** of variables at **compile-time**, not runtime. 
- If you assign to a variable inside a function, Python considers it **local**, even if used earlier in a global context.

  📌 **Example**:

```python
A = 10

def myfunc():
    print(A)  # Error: Local variable A referenced before assignment
    A = "Hello"

myfunc()
```

  - **Key Point**: Since `A` is assigned within the function, Python considers it local, causing an error when trying to print it before assignment.

---

## ⚡ Lambdas and Global Variables

- **Lambdas** are also functions and can access global variables.

  📌 **Example**:

```python
A = 10
F = lambda N: A ** N

print(F(2))  # Output: 100
```

  - **Key Point**: The lambda function can reference global variables like any other function.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Functions are Objects

- Functions themselves are **objects** and exist in some scope.
  - **Example**: `print` is a function in the **built-in scope**.

---

## 🔄 Redefining Built-in Functions

- You can overwrite **built-in functions** like `print`, but this can lead to unexpected behavior!

  📌 **Example**:

```python
print = lambda X: "Hello " + X
print("World")  # Output: Hello World
```

  - To restore the original functionality, you can use `del`:
  
```python
del print
print("World")  # Output: World
```

---

## 🛑 Block Scoping in Python (vs. Other Languages)

- In languages like **Java** or **C#**, variables declared in code blocks (e.g., loops) are local to those blocks.
- In **Python**, this is not the case—variables defined in loops are available outside the loop.
  
  📌 **Example**:

```python
for i in range(10):
    X = i ** 2

print(X)  # Output: 81 (X is still accessible)
```
