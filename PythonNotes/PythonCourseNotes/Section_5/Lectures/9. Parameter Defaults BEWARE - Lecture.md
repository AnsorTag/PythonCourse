Part 2: [[10. Parameter Defaults BEWARE AGAIN - Lecture]]

---
## 1. **Understanding Module Loading and Code Execution**
- **When a module is loaded** (imported or run as main), **all code is executed** immediately.
  - Example: `a = 10` creates an integer object and assigns it to `a`.
  - **Function definitions** (e.g., `def func(a): ...`) are also **executed at runtime**, but only **define** the function, they **do not execute it**.
  - The **function object is created** in memory, and `func` becomes a reference to that object.

## 2. **Default Values in Function Arguments**
- Example: `def func(a=10): ...`
  - When **def is executed**, it:
    - Creates the function.
    - Evaluates and assigns default values, like `a=10`.
  - **Important**: The **default value (10)** is created **once** at the time of function definition, not each time the function is called.

## 3. **The Issue with Mutable Default Values**
### Scenario: Logging Messages with Timestamps
- You may want a function like:
  ```python
  def log(message, *, dt=datetime.utcnow()):
      print(f"{dt}: {message}")
  ```
  - The problem: The `datetime.utcnow()` **is evaluated only once** when `def` runs, leading to **the same timestamp** for every call.
  - **What happens?**  
    Even if calls are made at different times, the timestamp **doesn't change** because the default `dt` was evaluated only once.

### 4. **Solution: Using `None` as a Default**
- **Fix**: Set the default to `None`, and inside the function, check if `dt` is `None`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def log(message, *, dt=None):
        dt = dt or datetime.utcnow()  # Use current time if dt is None
        print(f"{dt}: {message}")
    ```
  - **Explanation**: 
    - By checking `if dt is None`, you ensure the current time is assigned each time the function is called.

## 5. **General Advice: Beware of Mutable Objects**
- **Avoid using mutable objects** (like lists or dictionaries) as default arguments.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def func(a=[]):  # Avoid this!
        a.append(1)
        print(a)
    ```
  - **Problem**: The list is **shared** across all calls to the function.

- **Solution**: Use immutable objects (like `None`, tuples) or initialize the mutable object inside the function.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def func(a=None):
        if a is None:
            a = []
        a.append(1)
        print(a)
    ```

## 6. **Key Takeaways**
- **Default values** are **evaluated once** at function definition, not at each call.
- Use `None` as a default for mutable objects or values you want to change over time.
- Be mindful of mutable objects and their behavior when used as defaults.
