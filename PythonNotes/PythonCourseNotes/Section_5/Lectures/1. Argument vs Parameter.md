## 1. Introduction
Explore the **semantics** and **definitions** of *arguments* and *parameters* in Python.

## 2. Function Definition Example

```python
def myfunc(a, b):
    # Function logic here
    pass
```

### **Parameters**:
- **`a` and `b`** in the function definition are known as **parameters**.
- **Parameters** are just **variable names** and are local to `myfunc`.

## 3. Function Call Example

```python
x = 10
y = "A"
myfunc(x, y)
```

### **Arguments**:
- **`x` and `y`** in the function call are known as **arguments**.
- **Arguments** are the **values** passed into the function when it is called.

## 4. Key Concepts

### **Terminology**:
- **Parameters**: Variables listed in the function definition.
- **Arguments**: Values provided to the function during a call.
- **Common Mistakes**: 
  - People often mix up the terms "parameters" and "arguments," but it's generally understood what is meant, so it’s not a major issue.

### **Memory Address Passing**:
- **Arguments are passed by reference**:
  - When `myfunc(x, y)` is called:
    - The **memory address** of `x` is passed and stored in `a`.
    - The **memory address** of `y` is passed and stored in `b`.

## 5. Module Scope vs. Function Scope

### **Module Scope**:
- `x` and `y` are defined at the **module level**.
- `x` and `y` are **references** (pointers) to memory addresses where their respective values are stored.
  
### **Function Scope**:
- Inside `myfunc`, `a` and `b` are new **variable names** in the **function’s local scope**.
- However, `a` and `b` point to the **same memory addresses** as `x` and `y`.

### **Example Recap**:
- `x` and `a` point to the same integer value (`10`).
- `y` and `b` point to the same string (`"A"`).

## 6. Conclusion
- **Mixing terms**: It's fine if you mix up "arguments" and "parameters"; what's crucial is understanding that **variables in function definitions** are parameters, and **values in function calls** are arguments.
- **Memory reference**: Both parameters and arguments point to the **same memory locations** in their respective scopes.
