coding lesson notes: [[7. Reduction Function - Code]]

---
### What are Reducing Functions?

- **Definition**: Functions that **recombine an iterable** recursively, resulting in a **single returned value**.
- Other names: **Accumulators**, **Aggregators**, or **Folding Functions**.
  
### Example: Finding Maximum Value

- **Goal**: Find the **maximum value** in an iterable (sequence).
- The process involves taking a **sequence** and returning a **single value** based on all the elements.

```python
# Example sequence:
sequence = [5, 8, 6, 10, 9]

# Process:
1. Set result = first element (sequence[0])
2. Compare each following element with the result and update result if the current element is bigger.
3. Continue until all elements are checked.

# Code:
result = sequence[0]  # result starts at 5
for e in sequence[1:]:
    result = max(result, e)
# Final result is 10 (the max)
```

---

### Breaking Down the Code 💻

- **Initial Setup**:
  - Set `result` to the **first element**.
  
- **Loop**: 
  - For each element after the first (`sequence[1:]`):
    - Update `result` to the maximum of `result` and the current element.
    
- **Outcome**: After the loop ends, `result` holds the **maximum value**.

---

### Generalizing with Functions

You can generalize this logic with **any function**, not just max!

1. **Max Function**: Returns the larger of two values.

```python
max_value = lambda a, b: a if a > b else b
```

2. **Min Function**: Returns the smaller of two values.

```python
min_value = lambda a, b: a if a < b else b
```

3. **Reduce Function**: Reuses the same code structure but allows **any function** to be passed in as an argument.

```python
def _reduce(fn, sequence):
    result = sequence[0]
    for e in sequence[1:]:
        result = fn(result, e)
    return result
```

---

### Applying _reduce() 🔁

```python
# Max example
_reduce(lambda a, b: a if a > b else b, [5, 8, 6, 10, 9])
# Returns 10

# Min example
_reduce(lambda a, b: a if a < b else b, [5, 8, 6, 10, 9])
# Returns 5

# Sum example
_reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [5, 8, 6, 10, 9])
# Returns 38
```

---

### Using Python's Built-in `reduce()` 📦

- **From Functools**: Python provides a built-in `reduce` in the **`functools`** module.

```python
from functools import reduce

# Max with reduce:
reduce(lambda a, b: a if a > b else b, [5, 8, 6, 10, 9])
# Returns 10

# Min with reduce:
reduce(lambda a, b: a if a < b else b, [5, 8, 6, 10, 9])
# Returns 5

# Sum with reduce:
reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [5, 8, 6, 10, 9])
# Returns 38
```

---

### Key Differences Between `_reduce()` and Python's `reduce()`

- **Python’s `reduce()`** works with any **iterable** (e.g., sets, not just sequences like lists).
- `_reduce()` (our custom function) only works with sequences that support **indexing** and **slicing**.

```python
# Example with set:
set_data = {5, 8, 6, 10, 9}
reduce(lambda a, b: a if a > b else b, set_data)
# Returns 10
```

### 📝 1. Applying `_reduce` to Strings

- **Strings** are sequence types, meaning that `_reduce` can be applied to them.
- When we use `_reduce` with strings, we're essentially finding the **minimum character** based on **lexicographical order** (alphabetical order).

  - Example: `"hello"` → the minimum character is `"h"`, since it has the smallest ASCII value.

```python
reduce(min, "hello")  # returns 'h'
```

#### 🧠 Lexicographical Order
- Think of the ASCII table, where characters are sorted by their **numeric code**. The smallest character will have the lowest ASCII value.

---

### 📝 2. String Concatenation with `reduce`

We can also use `reduce` to **concatenate strings**, although a more efficient method exists using the `join()` function. Let's see how it works using `reduce` first:

```python
from functools import reduce

result = reduce(lambda a, b: a + ' ' + b, ("Python", "is", "awesome"))
# Result: "Python is awesome"
```

#### 🔍 How it works:
- The lambda function takes two values (`a` and `b`), adds a space between them, and concatenates them. 
  - **Iteration 1**: `"Python + ' ' + is"` → `"Python is"`
  - **Iteration 2**: `"Python is + ' ' + awesome"` → `"Python is awesome"`

- **Better way**: Use the `join()` method instead of `reduce`.

```python
result = ' '.join(["Python", "is", "awesome"])
# Result: "Python is awesome"
```

---

### 📝 3. Built-in Reducing Functions in Python

- Python has several **built-in reducing functions** that handle common tasks **without needing custom `reduce` functions**. Let’s look at some of them:

---

#### 🔍 Key Built-in Reducing Functions:

---

##### 1. `min()`
- Returns the **smallest element** in an iterable.

```python
min([5, 2, 8, 1])  # returns 1
```

##### 2. `max()`
- Returns the **largest element** in an iterable.

```python
max([5, 2, 8, 1])  # returns 8
```

##### 3. `sum()`
- Sums all the elements of an iterable.

```python
sum([5, 2, 8, 1])  # returns 16
```

##### 4. Boolean Reducing Functions: `any()` and `all()`

- These functions reduce an iterable based on **Boolean logic**:

###### 🔍 `any()`
- **Returns `True`** if **any** element in the iterable is truthy.

```python
any([0, "", None, 100])  # returns True (because 100 is truthy)
```

###### 🔍 `all()`
- **Returns `True`** if **every** element in the iterable is truthy.

```python
all([0, "", None, 100])  # returns False (because 0, "", and None are falsy)
```

#### 🧠 How `any()` and `all()` Work:
- **`any()`** applies a logical `or` between the truth values of each element.
- **`all()`** applies a logical `and` between the truth values of each element.

---

### 📝 4. Implementing Boolean Reduction Using `reduce`

---

#### 🔧 Implementing **`any()`** using `reduce`:

```python
from functools import reduce

sequence = [0, "", None, 100]
result = reduce(lambda a, b: bool(a) or bool(b), sequence)
# Returns True
```

- **How it works**:
  - **Step 1**: `False or False` → `False`
  - **Step 2**: `False or False` → `False`
  - **Step 3**: `False or True` → `True`

#### 🔧 Implementing **`all()`** using `reduce`:

```python
result = reduce(lambda a, b: bool(a) and bool(b), sequence)
# Returns False
```

---

### 📝 5. Calculating the Product of Elements with `reduce`

Python doesn’t have a built-in function to calculate the **product** of elements. But we can use `reduce` to implement it:

```python
from functools import reduce

sequence = [1, 3, 5, 6]
result = reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, sequence)
# Returns 90 (1 * 3 * 5 * 6)
```

---

### 📝 6. Factorial Calculation Using `reduce`

The factorial of a number `n` is the **product** of numbers from `1` to `n`.

```python
n = 5
result = reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, range(1, n + 1))
# Returns 120 (5!)
```

---

### 📝 7. Using the `initializer` Parameter in `reduce`

- The `reduce()` function has an optional third parameter called **`initializer`**, which acts as the **starting value** for the reduction.

```python
from functools import reduce

result = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [], 100)
# Returns 100 (since the list is empty)
```

#### 💡 Important Notes on `initializer`:
- If the **iterable is empty**, `reduce()` returns the initializer.
- The **initializer** is prepended to the iterable, acting as the **first value** in the reduction.

---

#### Example: **Summing with Initializer**

```python
result = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [1, 2, 3], 0)
# Returns 6 (0 + 1 + 2 + 3)
```

#### Example: **Product with Initializer**

```python
result = reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, [1, 2, 3], 1)
# Returns 6 (1 * 1 * 2 * 3)
```

#### ⚠️ Watch out!
- Use `0` as an initializer for **sums** and `1` for **products** to avoid altering the result.

---

### 📝 Summary

- You can use **`reduce()`** for **different data types**, like strings and numbers.
- **Python’s built-in reducing functions** (`min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `any()`, `all()`) offer simpler solutions for common tasks.
- The **initializer** in `reduce()` helps handle **empty iterables** safely and can control the starting value of the reduction.
