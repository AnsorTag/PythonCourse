coding lesson notes: [[2. Lambda Expressions - Code]]

---
**Lambda Expressions** are a way to create anonymous functions in Python. They provide a compact syntax for defining simple functions in a single line.

---

### Defining Functions with `def`:
- Functions are typically created using the `def` statement.
  ```python
  def myfunc(x):
      return x ** 2
  ```

- Functions have:
  1. A **name** (`myfunc` in this case).
  2. **Parameters** (e.g., `x`).
  3. A **return** statement.

---

### What are Lambda Expressions?
- **Lambda expressions** are an alternative way to define functions, but they don't have a name (thus "anonymous").
- Syntax:
  ```python
  lambda parameters: expression
  ```
  - `lambda`: Keyword signaling function creation.
  - `parameters`: List of arguments (optional, no parentheses required).
  - `expression`: Body of the function (must be a single expression).

- **Key Point**: The lambda expression returns a function object, similar to a `def`-defined function, but it doesnâ€™t execute until called.

---

### Example:
1. **Single parameter**:
   ```python
   lambda x: x ** 2
   ```
   This lambda takes one parameter `x` and returns `x ** 2`.

2. **Multiple parameters**:
   ```python
   lambda x, y: x + y
   ```
   This lambda takes two parameters and returns their sum.

3. **No parameters**:
   ```python
   lambda: "Hello"
   ```
   This lambda returns the string "Hello".

---

### Assigning Lambdas to Variables:
- Lambda expressions can be assigned to variables.
  ```python
  myfunc = lambda x: x ** 2
  ```
  This is functionally equivalent to:
  ```python
  def myfunc(x):
      return x ** 2
  ```

- You can now call the lambda function:
  ```python
  myfunc(3)  # Output: 9
  ```

---

### Passing Lambdas as Arguments:
- Lambdas can be passed as arguments to other functions.
  ```python
  def apply_func(x, fn):
      return fn(x)

  apply_func(3, lambda x: x ** 2)  # Output: 9
  apply_func(2, lambda x: x + 5)   # Output: 7
  ```

---

### Limitations of Lambdas:
- **Single Expression**: The body must be a single expression, which means no multi-line or complex statements.
  - You **cannot** do assignments inside a lambda.
    ```python
    lambda x: x = 5  # Invalid
    ```

- **No Annotations**: You can't add type annotations like in regular functions.
  ```python
  def myfunc(x: int) -> int:
      return x ** 2
  ```
  - Lambdas don't support this feature.

- **Default Arguments**: However, you can provide default values.
  ```python
  lambda x=5: x * 2
  ```

---

### Where to Use Lambdas:
- **Inline Functions**: Use lambdas for short, throwaway functions that can be used once or passed into other functions (e.g., sorting, filtering).
- For more complex logic, use a regular function (`def`).

---

### Conclusion:
Lambda expressions offer a concise way to define simple functions. They're particularly useful when you need a function for a short duration or as an argument to other functions. However, they have limitations like the inability to have multiple expressions or annotations.
