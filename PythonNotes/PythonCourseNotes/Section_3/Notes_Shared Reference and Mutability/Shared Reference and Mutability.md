# Shared References and Mutability
## Definition of Shared References
- **Shared Reference**: The concept where two variables reference the same object in memory (i.e., they point to the same object, sharing the same memory address).
- Example:
  ```python
    a = 10
    b = a
    ```
  - Here, both `a` and `b` reference the same object in memory.
  - **Key Point**: Python variables are memory references. The statement `b = a` does not copy the value but copies the memory reference.

## Shared References in Functions
- **Passing by Reference**: When passing variables to functions, the reference is passed, not the value.
  - Example:
    ```python
      def myfunc(v):
          pass
      t = 20
      myfunc(t)
      ```
    - `t` references an object in memory. When `myfunc(t)` is called, `v` in `myfunc` points to the same reference as `t`.
  - Shared references often occur in function calls, leading to the potential for side effects.

## Automatic Shared References
- **Unexpected Shared References**: Python may automatically create shared references under certain circumstances.
  - Example:
    ```python
      a = 10
      b = 10
      ```
    - We might expect `b` to point to a different object, but in fact, Python often makes `b` reference the same object as `a`.
  - This also occurs with strings:
    ```python
      s1 = "Hello"
      s2 = "Hello"
      ```
    - Both `s1` and `s2` point to the same string object in memory.
  - **Safety of Shared References**: This is safe because these objects (integers, strings) are immutable. Any modification to `b` or `s2` changes their memory reference, not the object itself.

## Mutability and Shared References
- **Mutable Objects**: Shared references with mutable objects require more caution.
  - Example:
    ```python
      a = [1, 2, 3]
      b = a
      ```
    - Both `a` and `b` reference the same list in memory.
  - If `b.append(100)` is called, the modification affects the list object, and consequently, `a` reflects this change too.
  - **Key Point**: Python does not create shared references automatically for mutable objects when they are defined separately.
    ```python
      a = [1, 2, 3]
      b = [1, 2, 3]
      ```
    - `a` and `b` will point to different objects in memory.

## Code Demonstrations
- **Setting Up Shared References**:
  - Example with strings:
    ```python
      a = "Hello"
      b = a
      ```
    - `a` and `b` share the same memory address.
  - Python automatically creates shared references:
    ```python
      a = "Hello"
      b = "Hello"
      ```
    - Both `a` and `b` share the same memory address.
  - Modifying `b`:
    ```python
      b = "Hello World"
      ```
    - `b` now references a different memory address, leaving `a` unchanged.

- **Shared References with Mutable Objects**:
  - Example with lists:
    ```python
      a = [1, 2, 3]
      b = a
      ```
    - Both `a` and `b` share the same memory address.
    - Modifying `b` (`b.append(100)`) also modifies `a`.

- **Automatic Shared References**:
  - Example with integers:
    ```python
      a = 10
      b = 10
      ```
    - Both `a` and `b` share the same memory address.
  - **Inconsistent Behavior**:
    ```python
      a = 500
      b = 500
      ```
    - `a` and `b` may have different memory addresses, as Python doesn’t always create shared references automatically.

## Conclusion
- **Summary**: 
  - Shared references occur frequently, especially with immutable objects.
  - When dealing with mutable objects, shared references can lead to unintended side effects.
  - Python’s automatic shared references are generally safe with immutable objects but be cautious with mutable ones.
