# Python Objects and Functions

## Overview
- In Python, **everything is an object**. This includes:
  - Data types
  - Operators
  - Functions
  - Classes
  - Even types themselves
- Objects in Python are instances of classes, meaning they have memory addresses and states.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Data Types as Objects
- Common data types like:
  - `int`, `bool`, `float`, `str`
  - `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`
  - **All are objects**
- Example: 
  ```python
  a = 10  # 'a' is an instance of the 'int' class
  ```

### 2. Operators as Objects
- Python operators (`+`, `-`, `==`, `is`) are also objects.
- The `Ellipsis` (`...`) is an operator and an object.

### 3. Functions and Classes as Objects
- **Functions** are instances of the `function` class.
- **User-defined classes** are instances of the `type` class.
- Functions have:
  - **Memory addresses**: Retrieve with `id()`
  - **States**: Include the code and variables within the function's scope
- Example:
  ```python
  def myfunc():  # Defines a function object
      pass
  myfunc  # Points to the function object
  ```

### 4. Memory Addresses
- Every object in Python, including functions, has a **memory address** that can be retrieved using `id()`.

### 5. First-Class Functions
- **Functions** in Python are first-class citizens:
  - **Assigned to variables**:
    ```python
    f = myfunc  # Assigns function to a variable
    f()  # Invokes the function through the variable
    ```
  - **Passed as arguments to other functions**:
    ```python
    exec_function(square, 3)
    ```
  - **Returned from other functions**:
    ```python
    def select_function(func_id):
        if func_id == 1:
            return square
        else:
            return cube
    ```
  - Important: To reference a function without invoking it, use the function name **without** parentheses (`myfunc` vs. `myfunc()`).

### 6. Examples and Usage
- **Assigning Functions:**
  ```python
  f = square  # Assigning function to variable
  f(2)  # Invoking the function through the variable
  ```
- **Returning Functions:**
  ```python
  def select_function(func_id):
      if func_id == 1:
          return square
      else:
          return cube
  ```
- **Passing Functions:**
  ```python
  def exec_function(fn, n):
      return fn(n)

  result = exec_function(cube, 3)  # Output: 27
  ```

## Conclusion
- Pythonâ€™s flexibility with objects, including functions and classes, allows for powerful and dynamic programming capabilities.
- Understanding that everything is an object in Python is fundamental to leveraging the language's full potential.

## Next Steps
- Explore advanced uses of functions:
  - **Decorators**
  - **Closures**
- These concepts will further demonstrate Python's power and flexibility.
